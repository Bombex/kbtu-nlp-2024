Tax equivalent income adjustment was $118,153 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, $116,330 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, $114,803 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, $99,961 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, and $90,406 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. This is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we believe provides investors with important information regarding our operational efficiency. Comparison of our adjusted efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible, because other companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently. Please see page 6 for more information on the calculation of our adjusted efficiency ratio. 4 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Statements This management s discussion and analysis and other portions of this report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), including statements of goals, intentions, and expectations as to future trends, plans, events or results of Company operations and policies, including but not limited to our outlook on earnings, statements regarding asset quality, concentrations of credit risk, our deposit portfolio and expected future changes in our deposit portfolio, the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, projected growth, capital position, our plans regarding and expected future levels of our non-performing assets, the pending merger with United Bankshares, Inc., business opportunities in our markets and strategic initiatives to capitalize on those opportunities, and general economic conditions. When we use words such as may, will, anticipates, believes, expects, plans, estimates, potential, continue, should, and similar words or phrases. you should consider them as identifying forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. These statements are based upon current and anticipated economic conditions, nationally and in the Company s market, interest rates and interest rate policy, competitive factors, and other conditions which by their nature, are not susceptible to accurate forecast, and are subject to significant uncertainty. Because of these uncertainties and the assumptions on which this discussion and the forward-looking statements are based, actual future operations and results may differ materially from those indicated herein. Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties: adverse governmental or regulatory policies may be enacted; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) could increase our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs, place restrictions on certain products and services, and limit our future capital raising strategies; the interest rate environment may compress margins and adversely affect net interest income; adverse effects may be caused by changes to credit quality; competition from other financial services companies in our markets could adversely affect operations; our concentrations of commercial, commercial real estate and construction loans, may adversely affect our earnings and results of operations; we may not be able to consummate the proposed merger between us and United Bankshares, Inc. on our anticipated timeline, or at all; an economic slowdown could adversely affect credit quality, loan originations and the value of collateral securing the Company s loans; and social and political conditions such as war, political unrest and terrorism or natural disasters could have unpredictable negative effects on our businesses and the economy. Other factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from estimates and projections contained in these forward-looking statements are discussed under Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Readers are cautioned against placing undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise publicly or otherwise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events, new information or future circumstances. 5 Non-GAAP Presentations This Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to the adjusted efficiency ratio, which is computed by dividing non-interest expense, by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income excluding impairment losses on securities, realized gains and losses on sale of securities and death benefits received from bank owned life insurance. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe provides investors with important information regarding our operational efficiency. Comparison of our adjusted efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible because other companies may calculate the adjusted efficiency ratio differently. The Company, in referring to its net income, is referring to income under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Calculation of the adjusted efficiency ratio for the specified years ended December 31, is as follows: Year Ended (in thousands) December 31, 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Summary Operating Results: Non-interest expense $ 64,239 $ 59,715 $ 61,110 $ 66,820 $ 44,776 Net interest income $ 106,667 $ 106,802 $ 105,329 $ 91,404 $ 83,038 Non-interest income 17,470 8,145 7,621 5,600 6,431 Impairment loss on securities 732 1,647 1,821 Gain on sale of securities (7,430 ) (503 ) (139 ) Death benefits received from bank owned life insurance (361 ) (1,045 ) Adjusted non-interest income $ 10,040 $ 8,013 $ 8,084 $ 7,421 $ 6,431 Total net interest income and non-interest income, adjusted (1) $ 116,707 $ 114,815 $ 113,413 $ 98,825 $ 89,469 Efficiency Ratio, GAAP (2) 51.8 % 52.0 % 54.1 % 68.9 % 50.1 % Adjusted Efficiency Ratio 54.4 % 51.3 % 53.2 % 66.9 % 49.5 % (1) Tax Equivalent Income of $118,153 for the year ended December 31, 2012, $116,330 for the year ended December 31, 2011, $114,803 for the year ended December 31, 2010, $99,961 for the year ended December 31, 2009, and $90,406 for the year ended December 31, 2008.

General The following presents management s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of the dates and for the periods indicated. The purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to provide investors and others with information that we believe to be necessary in understanding the financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations of our Company. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto, and other financial data appearing elsewhere in this report. The Company is the parent bank holding company for Virginia Commerce Bank (the Bank ), a Virginia state-chartered bank that commenced operations in May 1988. The Bank pursues a traditional community banking strategy, offering a full range of business and consumer banking services through twenty-eight branch offices, one residential mortgage office and one wealth management office. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, the Bank serves the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., including Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Loudoun, Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford Counties and the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Fredericksburg, Manassas and Manassas Park. Its service area also covers, to a 6 lesser extent, Washington, D.C. and the nearby Maryland counties of Montgomery and Prince Georges. The Bank s customer base includes small-to-medium sized businesses including firms that have contracts with the U.S. government, associations, retailers and industrial businesses, professionals and their firms, business executives, investors and consumers. Merger between the Company and United Bankshares, Inc. After the close of business on January 29, 2013, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Agreement ) with United Bankshares, Inc. ( United ). In accordance with the Agreement, the Company will merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of United (the Merger ). At the effective time of the Merger, the Company will cease to exist and the wholly-owned subsidiary of United shall survive and continue to exist as a Virginia corporation. The Agreement provides that at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to received 0.5442 shares of United common stock, par value $2.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided in the Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, the Company s outstanding stock options and trust preferred warrants will be converted into options to purchase United s common stock and warrants to purchase United common stock. In addition, the warrant held by the United State Department of Treasury to purchase common stock of the Company will be converted into a warrant to purchase common stock of United. After the effective time of the Merger, the Bank, will merge with and into United Bank, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of United (the Bank Merger ). United Bank will survive the Bank Merger and continue to exist as a Virginia banking corporation. Under the Agreement and subject to certain exceptions, the Company agreed to conduct its business in the ordinary course while the Merger is pending and, except as permitted under the Agreement, refrain from taking certain specific actions without the consent of United. Completion of the Merger is subject to approval by the shareholders of each of the Company and United, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Critical Accounting Policies During the year ended December 31, 2012, there were no changes in the Company s critical accounting policies as reflected in the Company s most recent annual or quarterly report. The Company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The financial information contained within our statements is, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. We use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio. Actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of our transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change. The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that are inherent in our loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (i) Accounting for Contingencies (ASC 450, Contingencies ), which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and (ii) Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan (ASC 310, Receivables ), which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance. Our allowance for loan losses has two basic components: the specific allowance and the general allowance. Each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur. The specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for impaired loans. Impairment testing includes consideration of the borrower s overall financial condition, resources and payment record, support available from financial guarantors and the fair market value of collateral. These factors are combined to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses based on the Company s calculation of the loss embedded in the individual loan. Large 7 groups of smaller balance, homogeneous loans, representing 1-4 family residential first and second trusts, including home equity lines-of-credit, are collectively evaluated for impairment based upon factors such as levels and trends in delinquencies, trends in loss and problem loan identification, trends in volumes and concentrations, local and national economic trends and conditions including estimated levels of housing price depreciation/homeowners loss of equity, competitive factors and other considerations. These factors are converted into reserve percentages and applied against the homogenous loan pool balances. Impaired loans which meet the criteria for substandard, doubtful and loss are segregated from performing loans within the portfolio. Internally classified loans are then grouped by loan type (commercial, real estate-one-to-four family residential, real estate-multi-family residential, real estate-non-farm, non-residential, real estate-construction, consumer, and farmland). The general formula is used to estimate the loss of non-classified loans. These un-criticized loans are also segregated by loan type and allowance factors are assigned by management based on delinquencies, loss history, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, the experience and depth of management, national and local economic trends, concentrations of credit, quality of the loan review system and the effect of external factors (i.e. competition and regulatory requirements). The factors assigned differ by loan type. The general allowance recognizes potential losses whose impact on the portfolio has yet to be recognized by a specific allowance. Allowance factors and the overall size of the allowance may change from period to period based on management s assessment of the above described factors and the relative weights given to each factor. For further information regarding the allowance for loan losses see Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion under the caption Asset Quality Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses at page 16. Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, management performs valuations of the foreclosed assets based on updated appraisals, general market conditions, recent sales of like properties, length of time properties have been held, and our ability and intention with regard to continued ownership of the properties. The Company may incur additional write-downs of foreclosed assets to fair value less costs to sell if valuations indicate a further other-than-temporary deterioration in market conditions. The Company s 1998 Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Plan ), which is stockholder approved, permitted the grant of share options to its directors and officers for up to 2.3 million shares of common stock. The Company s 2010 Equity Plan (the 2010 Plan ), which is also stockholder approved and replaces the 1998 Plan, permits the grant of share -based awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock, performance units, options and other awards to its directors, officers and employees for up to 1.5 million shares of common stock. To date, the Company has granted stock options and restricted stock under the 2010 Plan. The Company also has option awards outstanding under its 1998 Plan, but since May 2, 2010, the effective date of the 2010 Plan, no new awards can be granted under the 1998 Plan. The Company recognizes expense for its share-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company s stock at the date of grant, generally vest based on five years of continuous service and have ten-year contractual terms. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that currently uses historical volatility of the Company s stock based on a 7.2 year expected term, before exercise, for the options granted, and a risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury Department (the Treasury ) curve in effect at the time of the grant to estimate total stock-based compensation expense. This amount is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, currently five years, to salaries and benefits expense. Restricted stock awards generally vest in equal installments over five years. The compensation expense associated with these awards is based on the grant date fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period, currently five years, to salaries and benefits expense. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the plans and related compensation expenses. On a quarterly basis the Company reviews any securities which are considered to be impaired as defined by accounting guidance, to determine if the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary. If it is determined that the 8 impairment is other-than-temporary, i.e. impaired because of credit issues rather than interest rate, the investment is written down through a reduction in non-interest income on the Statement of Income in accordance with accounting guidance. In regard to debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the debt security prior to recovery, we will then evaluate whether a credit loss has occurred. To determine whether a credit loss has occurred, we compare the amortized cost of the debt security to the present value of the cash flows we expect to be collected. If we expect a cash flow shortfall, we will consider a credit loss to have occurred and will then consider the impairment to be other than temporary. We will recognize the amount of the impairment loss related to the credit loss in the results of operations, with the remaining portion of the loss recorded through comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding security impairments deemed to be other-than temporary. Financial Performance Overview For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company recorded net income of $30.1 million. After an effective dividend of $7.6 million to the Treasury on preferred stock, the Company recorded net income to common stockholders of $22.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted common share, with a return on average assets and return on average equity of 1.01% and 10.11%, respectively. The Company s financial performance in 2012 represents higher net income to common stockholders of $698 thousand as compared to $21.8 million for 2011. The primary factors driving this year-over-year increase are a $9.3 million increase in non-interest income offset by an increase in non-interest expense of $4.5 million and a $2.3 million increase in the effective dividend on TARP preferred stock. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded net income of $27.1 million. After an effective dividend of $5.3 million to the Treasury on preferred stock, the Company recorded net income to common stockholders of $21.8 million, or $0.71 per diluted common share, with a return on average assets and return on average equity of 0.95% and 10.23%, respectively. The Company s financial performance in 2011 represents higher net earnings, higher non-interest income and significantly lower provisions for loan losses from the year ending December 31, 2010 as the Company reported a $5.6 million increase in income from net income of $21.5 million in 2010. The year-over-year improvement in earnings was also attributable to reduced interest expense in the continued low interest rate environment and reduced non-interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded net income of $21.5 million. After an effective dividend of $5.0 million to the Treasury on preferred stock, the Company recorded net income to common stockholders of $16.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share, with a return on average assets and return on average equity of 0.77% and 9.22%, respectively. The financial performance in 2010 represents a strong turn around from the year ending December 31, 2009 results as the Company reported a $54.9 million increase in income from the $33.3 million loss in 2009. The most significant factor contributing to this improvement was the Company s management of its problem loans resulting in a charge of $20.6 million for its provision for loan losses in 2010 compared to a charge of $81.9 million in 2009. The Company also benefited from $6.0 million in reduced losses on OREO properties as those losses declined from $10.0 million in 2009 to $3.9 million in 2010. Total assets decreased $114.8 million, or 3.9%, from $2.94 billion at December 31, 2011, to $2.82 billion at December 31, 2012 and increased $196.9 million, or 7.2%, from $2.74 billion at December 31, 2010, to $2.94 billion at December 31, 2011 and increased $16.4 million, or 0.6%, from $2.73 billion at December 31, 2009, to $2.74 billion at December 31, 2010. Loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, increased $22.6 million, or 1.1%, from $2.12 billion at December 31, 2011, to $2.14 billion at December 31, 2012, as non-farm, non-residential real estate loans increased $22.3 million, or 1.92%, multifamily real estate loans increased $1.9 million, or 2.5%, commercial loans were up $8.6 million, or 3.4%, and ADC loans fell by $44.4 million, or 13.6%, from December 31, 2011, to December 31, 2012. During 2012, loan production was negatively impacted by a restrained demand for credit in both the business and consumer sectors as cautious borrowers awaited clearer economic signs and due to uncertainties relating to Federal budget cutbacks and sequestration. Additionally, the Company s loan portfolio was adversely affected by run-off particularly in commercial mortgage and acquisition, development and construction loans due to the historic low interest rate environment, aggressive interest rate competition and strategic decisions to restrict acquisition, development and construction lending and focus on greater portfolio diversification as well as deposit generation and non-credit products. Lending efforts during 2012 were directed toward building greater market share in commercial lending, including non-farm, non-residential owner-occupied real estate loans, and portfolio residential single family and multi-family mortgage lending. Loans continue to be the Company s primary asset class and driver of interest income. Total average loans for the twelve month period represented 75.0% and 78.5% of the Company s interest earning assets at December 31, 2012, and 2011 respectively. 9 In 2011, loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, decreased $29.3 million, or 1.4%, from $2.15 billion at December 31, 2010, to $2.12 billion at December 31, 2011, as commercial loans increased $33.8 million, or 15.5%, while non-farm, non-residential real estate loans decreased $5.9 million, or 0.5%, one-to-four family residential real estate loans decreased $28.0 million, or 7.0%, and ADC loans decreased $38.2 million, or 10.5%. During the first three quarters of 2011 year-over-year loan production was negatively impacted by a lower demand for credit in both the business and consumer sectors as cautious borrowers awaited clearer economic signs. Additionally, the Company s loan portfolio was adversely affected by run-off in both commercial and residential mortgage loans due to aggressive interest rate competition and strategic decisions to restrict acquisition, development and construction lending and focus on greater portfolio diversification as well as deposit generation and non-credit products. Lending efforts during 2011 were directed toward building greater market share in commercial lending, including non-farm, non-residential owner-occupied real estate loans, and particularly in sectors forecast for growth, such as government contract lending, professional practices, associations and select service industries, with strategic hiring, marketing campaigns and calling efforts. The Company s investment securities portfolio represents its second largest asset class and contributor to interest income, and is generally maintained as a primary source of liquidity. Investment securities decreased $131.5 million, or 21.0%, from $625.0 million at December 31, 2011, to $493.4 million at December 31, 2012, and increased $213.2 million, or 51.8%, from $411.8 million at December 31, 2010, to $625.0 million at December 31, 2011. The year-over-year decrease in securities was concentrated in U.S. Government agency securities, including mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). The Company s investment securities portfolio decreased significantly during 2012 as security maturities, principal pay downs, and sales exceeded the amount of investment purchases. During 2013, we may experience growth in the investment securities portfolio, but at a modest level based upon liquidity levels driven by loan demand and deposit activity. While loans are the Company s major asset, deposits are the Company s major source of funding and, as a result, the major contributor to interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2012, deposits decreased $46.8 million, or 2.0%, to $2.2 billion, with demand deposits increasing $78.2 million, or 23.1%, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits increasing by $26.8 million, or 2.3%, and time deposits falling $151.7 million, or 19.4%. As of December 31, 2012, non-interest bearing demand deposits represented 18.5% of total deposits. Demand, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits, grew year-over-year by $105.0 million to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2012. Over the past twelve months, generation of demand deposits was driven primarily by the successful efforts of the Company s team of eight business development officers, who are focused on acquisition and retention of commercial operating funds, treasury management services, and other related cross-sales. The reduction in time deposits during the past year has been intentional and resulted from a series of interest rate reductions that continued throughout 2012. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no brokered certificates of deposit. In 2011, deposits increased $45.0 million, or 2.0%, to $2.29 billion, with demand deposits increasing $73.2 million, or 27.6%, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits decreasing by $27.7 million, or 2.3%, and time deposits falling $516 thousand, or 0.07%. Demand deposit growth remains the top deposit priority, with the increase in demand deposits primarily due to the successful efforts of the Company s business development team, who are focused on acquisition and retention of commercial operating funds, treasury management services and other related cross-sale products. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no brokered certificates of deposit Stockholders equity decreased $38.5 million, or 13.6%, from $283.8 million at December 31, 2011, to $245.3 million at December 31, 2012, with a $67.2 million decline from the repayment of TARP preferred stock and a $2.8 million decrease in other comprehensive income, partially offset by net income available to common stockholders of $22.5 million over the twelve-month period, approximately $7.0 million in net proceeds from the exercise of warrants and $2.0 million in proceeds and tax benefits related to the exercise of options. As a result of these changes, the Company s Tier 1 capital ratio decreased from 14.55% at December 31, 2011, to 13.25% at December 31, 2012, and its total qualifying capital ratio decreased from 15.81% to 14.51% over the same period. In 2011, stockholders equity increased $38.2 million, or 15.5%, from $245.6 million at December 31, 2010, to $283.8 million at December 31, 2011, with net income to common stockholders of $21.8 million over the twelve-month period, approximately $6.2 million in additional capital, a $7.4 million increase in other comprehensive income related to the investment securities portfolio, $1.7 million in the accretion of the discount on preferred stock and $1.1 million in proceeds and tax benefits related to the exercise of options by the Company s directors and officers, and stock option expense credits. As a result of these changes, the Company s Tier 1 capital ratio increased from 13.20% at December 31, 2010, to 14.43% at December 31, 2011, and its total qualifying capital ratio increased from 14.45% to 15.68%. 10 On September 24, 2008, the Company raised $25.0 million in qualifying capital through the sale of trust preferred securities to the Company s directors and certain of its executive officers. In connection with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, the Company also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1.5 million shares of common stock to the purchasers. The trust preferred securities and the related warrants issued to insiders to purchase the Company s common stock remain outstanding. On December 12, 2008, the Company issued $71.0 million in preferred stock to the Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. In connection with the issuance of the preferred stock, the Company also issued to the Treasury a warrant to purchase approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock. On December 11, 2012, the Company announced that it had repurchased all of the $71.0 million in preferred stock that was issued to the Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. The TARP preferred stock had a carrying value of $68.6 million at September 30, 2012, net of the remaining discount. The Company accelerated the accretion of the preferred stock discount in the fourth quarter of 2012, which reduced net income available to common stockholders by approximately $2.1 million. The redemption will eliminate approximately $5.5 million annually in cash dividends on the preferred stock and related expenses. The related warrant issued to the Treasury to purchase shares of the Company s common stock remains outstanding. In 2013, the Company intends to negotiate with the Treasury to repurchase this warrant, subject to regulatory approval. Please refer to Capital Issuances at page 28 for additional discussion of the preferred stock issued under the Capital Purchase Program. On September 29, 2010, the Company issued 1,904,766 shares of its common stock at a price of $5.25 per share in a registered direct placement with several institutional investors for total gross proceeds of $10.0 million. In addition, the Company issued to the investors warrants exercisable for 1,904,766 additional shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00 per share. As of January 2012, 1,083,234 of these warrants had been exercised, providing an aggregate additional $6.5 million in gross proceeds to the Company, with the balance of the warrants having expired. On March 31, 2011, the Company issued 426,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $5.87 per share in a registered direct placement with a Company director for total gross proceeds of approximately $2.5 million. In addition, the Company issued to the investor warrants exercisable for 852,000 additional shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.62 per share. As of March 14, 2012, all of these warrants had been exercised, providing an aggregate additional $4.8 million in gross proceeds to the Company. Please refer to Capital Issuances at page 28 for more discussion of the issuance of securities in the registered direct placements. Net Interest Income Net interest income is the excess of interest earned on loans and investments over the interest paid on deposits and borrowings and is the Company s primary revenue source. Net interest income is thereby affected by overall balance sheet growth, changes in interest rates and changes in the mix of investments, loans, deposits and borrowings. For the year ending December 31, 2012, net interest income of $106.7 million was down 0.1%, compared to $106.8 million in 2011, as the net interest margin decreased from 3.91% in 2011, to 3.74% in 2012. The year-over-year decrease in the net interest margin was due to the prolonged low interest rate environment contributing to lower rates on loan and investment security assets, the impact of which was partially offset by lower costs on average interest-bearing deposits and securities sold under agreement to purchase. Deposit costs were 39 basis points lower during 2012 than in 2011 due to increased levels of demand deposits and lower rate interest-bearing transaction accounts, although this decrease was offset by a 28 basis point decrease in yield on loans and an 87 basis point decrease in yield on the investment securities portfolio. The decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio was primarily a result of the prolonged low interest rate environment that extended though 2012, and the decrease in the investment securities portfolio was driven by the continued low mortgage rate environment and our overall interest rate risk management process, which focused on the purchase of shorter term investment securities that lowered the yield on the investment securities portfolio, but also maintained a short average life of the investment security portfolio in the anticipation of deploying investment security proceeds into higher yielding loan assets in the near future. The prolonged low interest rate environment continued to put pressure on our loan yield as new loans were being originated at lower yields than the existing portfolio, adjustable rate loans were repriced downward in relationships without a protecting interest rate floor, and the normal amortization in the loan portfolio reduced higher yielding loans that were originated in prior years. The low mortgage environment continued to accelerate prepayments in our U.S. Government agency securities, including MBS and CMOs, resulting in increased amortization expense of premium paid on those securities, thereby contributing to the reduction in yield on the security portfolio. The pressure on loan yield due to those factors is partially offset from a NIM impact, as the shifting of interest-earnings assets from lower cost assets such as cash and securities are used to fund new loan originations at higher yields. The total market value of the MBS and CMOs sectors was reduced from $447.7 million, or approximately 71.0% of the total investment security portfolio, at December 31, 2011, to $328.1 million, or approximately 68.0% of the total investment security portfolio, at December 31, 2012. Overall, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits fell from 1.32% in 2011 to 0.93% in 2012, while yields on interest-earning assets fell from 5.17% in 2011 to 4.65% in 2012. 11 In 2011, net interest income of $106.8 million was up 1.4%, compared to $105.3 million in 2010, as the net interest margin rose slightly from 3.90% in 2010, to 3.91% in 2011 and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits fell from 1.64% in 2010, to 1.32% in 2011, while yields on interest-earning assets fell from an average of 5.50% in 2010 to 5.17% in 2011. As a result, the net interest margin rose from 3.90% in 2010, to 3.91% in 2011. Tables 1 and 2 provide further information with regard to yields, costs, the changes in net interest income and associated risk. 12 TABLE 1: AVERAGE BALANCES, INCOME AND EXPENSE, YIELDS AND RATES The following table shows the average balance sheets for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. In addition, the amounts of interest earned on interest-earning assets, with related yields, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, with related rates, are shown. Loans placed on a non-accrual status are included in the average balances. Net loan fees and late charges included in interest income on loans totaled $5.3 million, $4.2 million and $3.0 million for 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in thousands) Average Balance Interest Income- Expense Average Yields /Rates Average Balance Interest Income- Expense Average Yields /Rates Average Balance Interest Income- Expense Average Yields /Rates Assets Securities (1 ) $ 571,763 $ 11,849 2.28 % $ 499,996 $ 14,533 3.15 % $ 372,480 $ 14,684 4.12 % Restricted stock 11,139 428 3.84 % 11,533 382 3.32 % 11,752 356 3.03 % Loans, net of unearned income 2,169,441 120,297 5.56 % 2,176,439 126,706 5.84 % 2,259,560 133,599 5.92 % Interest-bearing deposits in other banks 140,631 364 0.26 % 27,640 71 0.26 % 249 0.09 % Federal funds sold 56,026 152 0.27 % 79,882 187 0.23 % Total interest-earning assets $ 2,892,974 $ 132,938 4.65 % $ 2,771,634 $ 141,844 5.17 % $ 2,723,923 $ 148,826 5.50 % Other assets 76,452 79,176 79,140 Total assets $ 2,969,426 $ 2,850,810 $ 2,803,063 Liabilities Stockholders Equity Interest-bearing deposits NOW accounts $ 371,740 $ 1,335 0.36 % $ 318,448 $ 2,139 0.67 % $ 335,716 $ 2,971 0.89 % Money market accounts 229,748 899 0.39 % 205,058 1,948 0.95 % 157,071 1,872 1.19 % Savings accounts 585,229 2,443 0.42 % 665,708 6,162 0.93 % 663,479 9,759 1.47 % Time deposits 692,269 12,871 1.86 % 782,435 15,789 2.02 % 882,832 18,860 2.14 % Total interest-bearing deposits $ 1,878,986 $ 17,548 0.93 % $ 1,971,649 $ 26,038 1.32 % $ 2,039,098 $ 33,462 1.64 % Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and federal funds purchased (2) 330,598 4,041 1.22 % 200,199 3,953 1.97 % 183,338 4,012 2.19 % Other borrowed funds 18,052 779 4.25 % 25,000 1,078 4.31 % 25,000 1,077 4.25 % Trust preferred capital notes 66,695 3,903 5.85 % 66,441 3,973 5.98 % 66,186 4,946 7.37 % Total interest-bearing liabilities $ 2,294,331 $ 26,271 1.15 % $ 2,263,289 $ 35,042 1.55 % $ 2,313,622 $ 43,497 1.88 % Demand deposits and other liabilities 377,357 322,705 255,871 Total liabilities $ 2,671,688 $ 2,585,994 $ 2,569,493 Stockholders equity 297,738 264,816 233,570 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 2,969,426 $ 2,850,810 $ 2,803,063 Interest rate spread 3.50 % 3.62 % 3.62 % Net interest income and margin $ 106,667 3.74 % $ 108,316 3.91 % $ 105,329 3.90 % (1) Yields on securities available-for-sale have been calculated on the basis of historical cost and do not give effect to changes in the fair value of those securities, which are reflected as a component of stockholders equity.

Also, included are wholesale agreements with an average balance of $75.0 million at an average rate of 4.52% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, and $75.0 million at an average rate of 4.52% for the same period for 2011. 13 TABLE 2: RATE-VOLUME VARIANCE ANALYSIS Interest income and expense are affected by changes in interest rates, by changes in the volumes of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and by changes in the mix of these assets and liabilities. Changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. The following analysis shows the year-to-year changes in the components of net interest income. 2012 compared to 2011 2011 compared to 2010 Increase/(Decrease) Due to Total Increase/ (Decrease) Increase/(Decrease) Due to Total Increase/ (Decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Volume Rate Volume Rate Interest Income Loans $ 19 $ (6,428 ) $ (6,409 ) $ (4,925 ) $ (1,968 ) $ (6,893 ) Securities 1,645 (4,329 ) (2,684 ) 3,475 (3,626 ) (151 ) Restricted Stock (15 ) 61 46 (7 ) 33 26 Interest bearing deposits in other banks 292 1 293 70 1 71 Federal funds sold (152 ) (152 ) (65 ) 30 (35 ) Total interest income $ 1,941 $ (10,847 ) $ (8,906 ) $ (1,452 ) $ (5,530 ) $ (6,982 ) Interest Expense Interest-bearing deposits: NOW accounts $ 197 $ (1,001 ) $ (804 ) $ (116 ) $ (716 ) $ (832 ) Money market accounts 102 (1,152 ) (1,050 ) 456 (380 ) 76 Savings accounts (319 ) (3,399 ) (3,718 ) 21 (3,618 ) (3,597 ) Time deposits (1,438 ) (1,480 ) (2,918 ) (1,606 ) (1,465 ) (3,071 ) Total interest-bearing deposit expense $ (1,458 ) $ (7,032 ) $ (8,490 ) $ (1,245 ) $ (6,179 ) $ (7,424 ) Securities sold under agreement to repurchase and federal funds purchased 1,594 (1,506 ) 88 333 (391 ) (58 ) Other Borrowed funds (283 ) (16 ) (299 ) Trust preferred capital notes 26 (96 ) (70 ) 15 (988 ) (973 ) Total interest expense $ (121 ) $ (8,650 ) $ (8,771 ) $ (897 ) $ (7,558 ) $ (8,455 ) Change in Net Interest Income $ 2,062 $ (2,197 ) $ (135 ) $ (555 ) $ 2,028 $ 1,473 Asset/Liability Management and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to market risk, or interest rate risk, as its net income is largely dependent on its net interest income. Market risk is managed by the Company s Asset/Liability Management Committee which formulates and monitors the performance of the Company based on acceptable levels of market risk as dictated by policy. In setting tolerance levels, or limits on market risk, the Committee considers the impact on earnings and capital, the level and general direction of interest rates, liquidity, local economic conditions and other factors. Interest rate risk, or interest sensitivity, can be defined as the amount of forecasted net interest income that may be gained or lost due to favorable or unfavorable movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk, or interest sensitivity, arises when the maturity or repricing of interest-earning assets differs from the maturing or repricing of interest-bearing liabilities and as a result of the difference between total interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Company seeks to manage interest rate sensitivity while enhancing net interest income by periodically adjusting this asset/liability position. In order to closely monitor and measure interest sensitivity, the Company uses earnings simulation models on a quarterly basis. We use a duration gap of equity approach to manage our long-term interest rate risk. This approach uses a model which generates estimates of the change in our market value of portfolio equity ( MVPE ) over a range of interest rate scenarios. MVPE is the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities using various assumptions about estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates. Our short term interest rate sensitivity is managed through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in the net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios. Net interest income depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. The model assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at December 31, 2012, remains constant over a two-year period (base case) and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. 14 The following table provides an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in MVPE and net interest income from the base case, resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates as of December 31, 2012 (in thousands): Sensitivity of Market Value of Portfolio Equity December 31, 2012 Sensitivity of Net Interest Income December 31, 2012 Market Value of Portfolio Equity Net Interest Income Interest Rate Scenario Percent Percent Up 200 bps 11.6 % +5.2 % Up 300 bps 21.8 % +7.0 % Down 100 bps +2.3 % 6.1 % Management believes the modeled results are consistent with the short duration of its balance sheet, given the many variables that affect the actual timing of when assets and liabilities will reprice. Since the earnings model uses numerous assumptions regarding the effect of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent of repricing characteristics, future cash flows and customer behavior, the model cannot precisely estimate net income and the effect on net income from sudden changes in interest rates. Actual results will differ from the simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. Non-Interest Income The Company s non-interest income sources include service charges and other fees on deposit accounts, fees and net gains from loans originated and sold through its mortgage lending division, commissions from non-deposit investment sales and increases in the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance policies. For the year ended December 31, the Company recognized non-interest income of $17.5 million, compared to non-interest income of $8.1 million for the same period in 2011. For 2012, non-interest income included a gain on sale of securities of $7.4 million, while non-interest income for the same period in 2011 included an impairment loss on securities of $732 thousand, which was offset by a gain on sale of securities of $503 thousand and a bank-owned life insurance death benefit of $361 thousand. The Company engaged in sales of investment securities to generate sizable gains during 2012 as part of liquidity management, which included the need to increase cash levels to support the repurchase of all TARP preferred stock, fund the intentional run-off of high cost time deposits and securities sold under agreement to repurchase with customers, and to take advantage of favorable investment prices during the low interest rate environment. In 2011, non-interest income of $8.1 million was up 6.9%, compared to $7.6 million for the same period in 2010. Impairment loss on securities was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, which decreased to $732 thousand for 2011. Excluding the year-over-year improvement in impairment losses on securities, other sources of non-interest-income decreased $391 thousand from 2010 to 2011. Investment services commissions increased $559 thousand to $1.4 million during 2011, which partially offset a $515 thousand decrease from 2010 to 2011 in fees and net gains on mortgage loans originated and sold and a $408 thousand decrease from 2010 to 2011 in income on bank-owned life insurance. Service charges and other fees, which include monthly deposit account maintenance charges, overdraft fees, ATM fees and charges, debit card interchange income, safe deposit box rents, merchant discount fee income, and lock-box service fees, increased $254 thousand, or 7.7%, from $3.3 million in 2011, to $3.6 million in 2012, and decreased $73 thousand, or 2.2%, from $3.4 million in 2010, to $3.3 million in 2011. The decline in 2011 was due to lower levels of overdraft fees. For 2012, fees and net gains on loans held-for-sale increased $1.6 million, or 53.5%, compared to the same period in 2011 and were down $515 thousand in 2011, from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, to $2.9 million for the same period in 2011. Mortgage loans held-for sale totaling $210.1 million were closed in the year ended 2012, as compared to $155.2 million to the same period for 2011. In 2012, the Company originated $210.1 million and sold $217.4 million to investors, compared to $155.2 million originated and $149.3 million sold in 2011. The increased gains and fees on loans held for sale during 2012 were driven by higher volumes of mortgage loans originated for sale and sold to investors. 15 Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense increased $4.5 million, or 7.6%, from $59.7 million in 2011, to $64.2 million in 2012, and decreased $1.4 million, or 2.3%, from $61.1 million in 2010, to $59.7 million in 2011. In 2012, salaries and employee benefits increased $2.8 million, or 10.5%, to $29.9 million from $27.1 million in 2011. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to higher commissions associated with an increase in mortgage loan production. In 2011, salaries and benefits increased $2.1 million, or 8.4%, to $27.1 million from $25.0 million in 2010. The increase in 2011 was due to higher employee incentive compensation, additional personnel growth, general merit increases, and other employee benefits. Losses and expenses on other real estate owned increased $2.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2011 to the same period in 2012, as the Company s balance of other real estate owned increased 37.8% to $12.3 million during that period. Franchise tax expense increased $266 thousand from 2011 to 2012, but was offset by reductions of $1.3 million in FDIC insurance expense from 2011 to 2012. Occupancy expenses increased $74 thousand, or 0.8%, from $9.4 million in 2011, to $9.5 million in 2012. Occupancy expenses decreased $525 thousand, or 5.3%, from $10.0 million in 2010, to $9.4 million in 2011. Income Taxes The Company s income tax provisions are adjusted for non-deductible expenses and non-taxable interest after applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 35%. The provision for income taxes totaled $15.0 million, $13.3 million and $9.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rate was 33.2%, 32.9%, 31.1%, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. For further information regarding the provisions for income taxes see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Asset Quality Provision and Allowance For Loan Losses For the year ended December 31, 2012, provisions for loan losses were $14.8 million, with total net charge-offs in 2012 of $20.8 million, down 27.2%, from $28.6 million in 2011, as the Company continued to reduce its non-performing loan balances. In 2010, provisions totaled $20.6 million with total net charge-offs of $23.3 million. As a result of these provisions and charge-offs, the total allowance for loan losses decreased $6.0 million, or 12.20% from $48.7 million at December 31, 2011, to $42.8 million at December 31, 2012, decreased $13.7 million, or 22.0%, from $62.4 million at December 31, 2010 to $48.7 million at December 31, 2011. Total non-performing assets and loans 90+ days past due increased $2.4 million from $47.8 million at December 31, 2011, to $50.2 million at December 31, 2012. As a percentage of total assets, non-performing assets increased from 1.63% at December 31, 2011, to 1.78% at December 31, 2012. The increase in non-performing assets of $2.4 million from December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, coupled with the decrease in the allowance for loan losses of $5.9 million in the same period, contributed to the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans coverage ratio declining to 112.8% at December 31, 2012, compared to 125.4% at December 31, 2011. The qualitative factors used in calculating the loan loss, such as a historical reduction in charge-offs, was a factor in the decline in the coverage ratio. We believe the allowance at December 31, 2012 was appropriate for the level of portfolio risk measured. Non-performing assets and loans greater than 90 days past due declined 35.9% from $74.6 million at December 31, 2010, to $47.8 million at December 31, 2011. As a percent of total loans, the allowance decreased from 2.82% as of December 31, 2010, to 2.24% as of December 31, 2011, and as a percent of non-performing loans the allowance increased from 108.8% at December 31, 2010, to 125.4% at December 31, 2011. The decreases in allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012, is primarily due to charge-offs incurred during 2012 that were supported by specific reserves in the allowance for loan losses during 2011. The Company made significant progress in reducing non-performing assets and loans greater than 90 days past due during 2012. See Risk Elements and Non-Performing Assets later in this discussion for more information on non-performing assets and loans greater than 90 days past due and other impaired loans. 16 Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate at December 31, 2012. However, there can be no assurance that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required in the future, including as a result of possible changes in the economic assumptions underlying management s estimates and judgments, adverse developments in the economy, and the residential and commercial real estate markets in particular, on a national basis or in the Company s market area, or changes in the circumstances of particular borrowers. The Company generates a quarterly analysis of the allowance for loan losses, with the objective of quantifying portfolio risk into a dollar figure of inherent losses, thereby translating the subjective risk value into an objective number. Emphasis is placed on at least semi-annual independent external loan reviews and monthly internal reviews. The determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on applying and summing the results of eight qualitative factors and a historical loss factor to each category of loans along with any specific allowance for impaired and adversely classified loans within the particular category. Each factor is assigned a percentage weight and that total weight is applied to each loan category. The resulting sum from each loan category is then combined to arrive at a total allowance for all categories. Factors are different for each loan category. Qualitative factors include: levels and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of any changes in lending policies, the experience, ability and depth of management, national and local economic trends and conditions, concentrations of credit, quality of the Company s loan review system, and regulatory requirements. The total allowance required thus changes as the percentage weight assigned to each factor is increased or decreased due to its particular circumstance, as historical loss factors are updated, as the various types and categories of loans change as a percentage of total loans and as specific allowances are required on impaired loans and charge-offs occur. For further information regarding the allowance for loan losses see Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The allocation is an estimate and should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs will occur in these amounts, or that the allocation indicates future trends. The allocation of the allowance at December 31, for the years indicated and the ratio of related outstanding loan balances to total loans are as follows: (Dollars in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Allocation of allowance for loan losses: Commercial $ 5,455 $ 10,378 $ 9,972 $ 11,241 $ 8,489 Real estate-non-farm, non-residential 11,592 12,554 16,453 17,284 7,047 Real estate-construction 14,939 15,161 26,584 26,862 18,460 Consumer 167 245 373 440 126 Real estate-one-to-four family residential 10,420 9,724 8,337 8,969 2,128 Real estate-multi-family residential 78 608 619 261 200 Farmland 122 59 63 84 25 Unallocated 41 11 Balance, December 31, $ 42,773 $ 48,729 $ 62,442 $ 65,152 $ 36,475 Ratio of loans to total year-end loans: Commercial 11 % 11 % 9 % 10 % 12 % Real estate mortgage 75 % 73 % 73 % 70 % 62 % Real estate construction 13 % 15 % 17 % 19 % 25 % Consumer 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % See Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the provision and allowance for loan losses. Risk Elements and Non-Performing Assets Non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans and other real estate owned. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the total non-performing assets and loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing interest increased by $2.4 million, or 5.1%, from $47.8 million at December 31, 2011, to $50.2 million at December 31, 2012, and decreased by $26.8 million, or 35.9%, from $74.6 million at December 31, 2010, to $47.8 million at December 31, 2011. The increase in total non-performing assets during 2012 was driven by a $3.4 million increase in other real estate owned during 2012. As a result, the ratio of non-performing assets and loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing to total assets increased from 1.63% at December 31, 2011, to 1.78% at December 31, 2012, and decreased from 2.72% at December 31, 2010, to 1.63% at December 31, 2011. Loans are placed in non-accrual status when in the opinion of management the collection of additional interest is unlikely or a specific loan meets the criteria for non-accrual status established by regulatory authorities. No interest is taken into income on non-accrual loans. A loan remains on non-accrual status until the loan is current as to both principal and interest or the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current, or both. Our underwriting for new acquisition, development, and construction loans always includes the interest cost for the loan whether an interest reserve is approved or not. In other words, the equity requirement in the new loan is established reflecting the amount of interest required to serve the project. We continually monitor the adequacy of reserve requirements, including interest reserves, during the draw process to ensure the project is being completed on time and within budget. We have restructured loans due to the slow market, re-underwriting each loan based on time and cost to complete. We do not continue funding interest reserves just to keep the loan from becoming non-performing. We consider whether the loan to value ratio will support current and future advances and whether the project is meeting certain completion criteria necessary to successfully complete the project. Once a loan becomes non-performing, we do not allow draws on interest reserves. 18 Other impaired loans that are currently performing, and troubled debt restructurings performing in accordance with their modified terms, decreased from $160.2 million at December 31, 2011, to $134.1 million at December 31, 2012. These loans have been identified by the Company as having certain weaknesses as a result of the Company s specific knowledge about the customer or recent credit events, and are classified as substandard and subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date. Troubled debt restructurings represented $43.5 million, of total impaired loans as of December 31, 2012 and $52.3 million, of total impaired loans as of December 31, 2011. For December 31, 2010 and 2009, troubled debt restructurings represented $103.0 million and $71.9 million, respectively, of total impaired loans. There were no troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2008. In 2012, Troubled Debt Restructurings saw a net decrease of $8.8 million. TDRs were increased on a gross basis by $18 million, comprised of ten loans classified as TDR s totaling $17.5 million and additions to existing TDRs totaling $500,000. Gross TDR deductions totaled $26.8 million and were comprised as follows: Sales proceeds on seven real estate loans totaling $9.8 million, payments on TDR loans totaling $1.2 million, eight loans removed from TDR classification based on payment performance totaling $6.5 million, One loan upgraded in the amount of $3.4 million, partial charge-offs on one loan relationship totaling $2.6 million, a $600,000 charge-off on one loan associated with a discounted note payoff, and eight loans transferred to non-accrual totaling $2.7 million. These loans which have been provided concessions such as rate reductions, payment deferrals, and in some cases forgiveness of principal, are all on accrual status. If the loan was on non-accrual at the time of the concession, it is the Company s policy that it remain on non-accrual status and perform in accordance with the modified terms for a period of six months. All loans reported as troubled debt restructurings accrue interest. If a troubled debt restructuring is on non-accrual status, it is reported as a non-accrual asset and not as a troubled debt restructuring. Troubled debt restructurings continue to be individually tested for impairment for a period of one year from their modification date. Total non-performing assets consist of the following: TABLE 5: NON-PERFORMING ASSETS December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Non-accrual loans $ 37,929 $ 38,536 $ 57,158 $ 65,809 $ 111,234 Other real estate owned 12,302 8,925 17,165 28,499 7,569 Total non-performing assets $ 50,231 $ 47,461 $ 74,323 $ 94,308 $ 118,803 Loans past due 90 days and still accruing 332 242 3,826 6,118 Total non-performing assets and past due loans $ 50,231 $ 47,793 $ 74,565 $ 98,134 $ 124,921 Troubled debt restructurings $ 43,448 $ 52,264 $ 102,996 $ 71,885 Allowance for loan losses to total loans 1.95 % 2.24 % 2.82 % 2.86 % 1.58 % Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans 112.77 % 125.37 % 108.79 % 93.56 % 31.08 % Non-performing assets and past due loans to total loans 2.29 % 2.18 % 3.37 % 4.31 % 5.40 % Non-performing assets and past due loans to total assets 1.78 % 1.63 % 2.72 % 3.60 % 4.60 % Non-performing loans continue to be concentrated in residential and commercial construction and land development loans in outer sub-markets hardest hit by the residential downturn and commercial and consumer credits experiencing the after shocks in sub-contracting businesses and unemployment levels. Overall, as of December 31, 2012, $22.8 million, or 60.2%, of non-performing loans represented acquisition, development and construction ( ADC ) loans, $5.7 million, or 14.9%, represented non-farm, non-residential loans, $6.1 million, or 16.1%, represented loans on one-to-four family residential properties, and $3.3 million, or 8.7%, represented commercial and industrial ( C I ) loans. The Company would have recorded additional gross interest income of approximately $2.3 million for 2012 and 2011 and $3.4 million for 2010, if non-accrual loans had been current throughout those periods. Interest actually received on non-accrual loans was $394 thousand for 2012, zero for 2011 and $158 thousand in 2010. See Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company s non-performing assets. 19 Tables 6 and 7 provide a breakdown of the construction loan portfolio by location including loans on non-accrual status and percentage of net-charge offs in 2012.

Such properties, which are held for resale, are carried at fair value, including a reduction for the estimated selling expenses. Reviews and discussions with regard to value and disposition of each foreclosed property are conducted monthly by the Company s Special Assets Committee. The carrying value of a foreclosed asset is immediately adjusted down when new information is obtained, including a potentially acceptable offer, the sale of a similar property in the vicinity of one of the Company s assets, and/or a change in the price the property is being listed for. The Company recorded $3.2 million in expenses and losses on other real estate owned in 2012 and $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The following tables provide a breakdown of other real estate owned by type and a roll-forward of other real estate owned activity for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: TABLE 9: OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED BY TYPE (Dollars in thousands) Year-end December 31, 2012 2011 Residential Land $ 3,672 $ 3,438 Residential Building 3,044 1,432 Commercial Land 3,029 1,230 Commercial Building 2,557 2,825 Total other real estate owned $ 12,302 $ 8,925 TABLE 10: OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED ACTIVITY (Dollars in thousands) Year-ended December 31, 2012 2011 Beginning Balance $ 8,925 $ 17,165 Additions 15,946 12,726 Capital improvements 99 558 Valuation adjustments (1,485 ) (542 ) Dispositions (9,487 ) (20,440 ) (Loss) on disposition (1,696 ) (542 ) Ending Balance $ 12,302 $ 8,925 21 Other real estate owned increased $3.4 million, or 37.8% during 2012, from $8.9 million at December 31, 2011 to $12.3 million at December 31, 2012. This increase was principally due to additions to other real estate owned of $15.9 million during 2012 as compared to $12.7 million in 2011 and dispositions of $9.5 million during 2012, as compared to $20.4 million during 2011. Loan Portfolio The Bank s lending activities are its principal source of income. Real estate loans, including residential permanents and construction, and commercial permanents, represent the major portion of the Bank s loan portfolio. Loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $22.6 million, or 1.1%, from $2.12 billion at December 31, 2011, to $2.14 billion at December 31, 2012. This includes an increase in non-farm, non-residential real estate loans of $22.3 million, or 2.0% during 2012. In addition, during 2012 one-to-four family residential increased $26.9 million or 7.2%, multifamily real estate loans increased $1.9 million, or 2.5%, C I loans were up $8.6 million, or 3.4%, and ADC loans fell by $44.4 million, or 13.6%, from December 31, 2011, to December 31, 2012. In 2011, loans, net of allowance for loan losses, decreased $29.3 million, or 1.4%, from $2.15 billion at December 31, 2010, to $2.12 billion at December 31, 2011. This includes an increase in commercial and industrial loans of $33.8 million, or 15.5%, while non-farm, non-residential real estate loans decreased $5.9 million, or 0.5%, one-to-four family residential real estate loans decreased $28.0 million, or 7.0%, and real estate construction loans decreased $38.2 million, or 10.5%. At December 31, 2012, $156.2 million of real estate construction loans were to commercial builders of single-family housing, $13.8 million were to individuals on single-family properties and $112.1 million were related to commercial properties. At December 31, 2011, $136.7 million of real estate construction loans were to commercial builders of single-family housing, $14.4 million were to individuals on single-family properties and $175.3 million were related to commercial properties. As noted above, the majority of the Bank s loan portfolio consists of construction and commercial mortgage real estate loans. At December 31, 2012, the Bank had $156.2 million of construction loans to commercial builders of single family housing in the Northern Virginia market, representing 7.1% of total loans. These loans are made to a number of unrelated entities and generally have a term of twelve to eighteen months. The Bank had $1.16 billion, or 52.8% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2012, secured by non-farm non-residential properties with $486.5 million, or 22.2% of the loan portfolio representing owner-occupied non-farm, non-residential properties. These non-farm, non-residential loans represent obligations of a diversified pool of borrowers across numerous businesses and industries, primarily in the Northern Virginia market and include some loans that, although secured by commercial real estate, are commercial purpose loans made based on the financial condition of the underlying business. In addition, the Bank had $261.0 million, or 11.9% of commercial loans to businesses and organizations, including trade associations, professional corporations, community associations, government contractors, medical practitioners, property management companies, religious organizations and houses of worship, heavy equipment contractors and others primarily located in the Northern Virginia market. These commercial loans generally represent short term obligations to support working capital needs and/or term loans to finance the purchase of business assets. At December 31, 2012, the Company had no other concentrations of loans in any one industry exceeding 10% of its total loan portfolio. An industry for this purpose is defined as a group of counterparties that are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.

The securities portfolio consists of two components, securities held-to-maturity and securities available-for-sale. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity based on management s intent and the Company s ability, at the time of purchase, to hold such securities to maturity. These securities are carried at amortized cost. Securities which may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the securities prepayment risk, increased loan demand, general liquidity needs, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at estimated fair value. Total securities decreased $131.5 million, or 21.0%, year-over-year from $625.0 million at December 31, 2011, to $493.4 million at December 31, 2012, and increased $213.2 million, or 51.8%, year-over-year from $411.8 million at December 31, 2010, to $625.0 million at December 31, 2011. The large decline in the investment securities portfolio from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012, was largely the result of a reduction in investment security collateral needs for securing securities sold under agreements to repurchase with customers, and the sale of $24.9 million in investment securities in December 2012 that was not reinvested until the first quarter of 2013. As of December 31, 2012, the Company has securities to one issuer which was in excess of 10% of stockholders equity. Virginia State Housing Development Authority had an aggregate book value of $27.4 million, with a market value of $29.0 million as of December 31, 2012. The increase in the investment securities portfolio in 2011 was funded by increased levels of liquidity, primarily driven by reductions in the loan portfolio and increases in the deposit portfolio. During 2012, the Company transferred its entire held-to-maturity (HTM) securities portfolio, with an amortized cost of $30.0 million and a fair value of $32.5 million to its available-for-sale securities portfolio, to its available-for-sale (AFS) securities portfolio. AFS securities represented 94.8% of the total investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2011. The transfer does not represent a change in the Company s investment strategy, merely a reclassification of securities to align with management s intention to hold all securities in its portfolio as AFS. The investment portfolio contains two pooled trust preferred securities with an amortized cost of $5.1 million, and a market value of $357 thousand at December 31, 2012. The Bank performs a quarterly analysis of these securities for other than temporary impairment due to significantly depressed current market value indications. The analysis includes stress tests on the underlying collateral and cash flow estimates based on the current and projected future levels of deferrals and defaults within each pool. There has been no recorded impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to an aggregate impairment loss of $732 thousand for the same time period in 2011. In 2010, the Bank recorded an impairment loss of an aggregate of $1.6 million. 24 Table 13 provides information regarding the composition of the securities portfolio and Table 14 details the maturities and weighted average yields (on a tax equivalent basis) at the dates indicated. U.S. Government Agency obligations include senior debt issuances, mortgage-backed pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by the Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Federal National Mortgage Association.

The majority of the Bank s deposits are attracted from individuals and businesses in the Northern Virginia and the metropolitan Washington D.C. area, and the interest rates the Bank pays are based on our overall deposit pricing strategies and consider the competitive markets that we operate in. Total deposits decreased $45.0 million, or 2.0%, from $2.29 billion at December 31, 2011, to $2.25 billion at December 31, 2012, and increased $45.0 million, or 2.0%, from $2.25 billion at December 31, 2010, to $2.29 billion at December 31, 2011. In 2012, growth by deposit category included an increase in demand deposits of $78.2 million, or 23.1%, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits increased by $26.8 million, or 2.3%, and time deposits declined $151.7 million, or 19.4%. As of December 31, 2012, non-interest bearing demand deposits represented 18.5% of total deposits. Demand, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits, grew year-over-year by $105.0 million to $1.6 25 billion at December 31, 2012. Over the past twelve months, generation of demand deposits was driven primarily by the successful efforts of the Company s team of eight business development officers, who are focused on acquisition and retention of commercial operating funds, treasury management services, and other related cross-sales. The reduction in time deposits during the past year has been intentional and resulted from a series of interest rate reductions that continued throughout 2012. In 2011, growth by deposit category included an increase in demand deposits of $73.2 million, or 27.6%, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits decreasing by $27.7 million, or 2.3%, and time deposits declining $516 thousand, or 0.07%. The year-over-year increase in demand deposits is primarily due to successful efforts of the Company s business development teams, who are focused on acquisition and retention of commercial operating funds, treasury management services and other related cross-sale products. Table 15 details maturities of time deposits with balances of $100,000 or more, which represent 42.4% of total time deposits as of December 31, 2012, compared to 41.1% at December 31, 2011. Total time deposits represent 28.0% of total deposits as of December 31, 2012, compared to 34.1% at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Bank had no brokered time deposits, exclusive of reciprocal deposits. Reciprocal deposits totaled $49.0 million at December 31, 2012 and $95.9 million at December 31, 2011, representing a 48.9% decline during 2012. Reciprocal brokered time deposits are deposits that have been placed into a deposit placement service which allows us to place our customers funds in FDIC-insured time deposits at other banks and at the same time, receive an equal sum of funds from customers of other banks within the deposit placement service. Reciprocal deposits totaled $106.2 million at December 31, 2010. The Bank considers various brokered deposit products as tools to manage deposit costs, interest rate risk, and the mix of deposits. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Table 1 to this Management s Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding the maturities of time deposits and average rates paid on all interest-bearing deposits.

The secured transactions with customers are provided to significant commercial demand deposit customers and are considered a core funding source of the Bank. Short-term borrowings also include Federal funds purchased, which are unsecured overnight borrowings from other banks and are generally used to accommodate short-term liquidity needs. Table 16 provides information on the balances and interest rates on short-term borrowings for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (dollars in thousands): TABLE 16: SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS At December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Securities sold under agreement to repurchase $ 250,718 $ 263,273 $ 152,726 Weighted interest rate at year end 1.20 % 1.43 % 2.43 % Averages for the year ended December 31, Outstanding $ 330,598 $ 200,199 $ 183,338 Interest rate 1.22 % 1.97 % 2.19 % Maximum month-end outstanding $ 414,158 $ 278,459 $ 210,208 Liquidity The Company s principal source of liquidity and funding is its deposit base. The level of deposits necessary to support the Company s lending and investment activities is determined through monitoring loan demand. Considerations in managing the Company s liquidity position include, but are not limited to, scheduled cash flows from existing loans and investment securities, anticipated deposit activity including the maturity of time deposits, and projected needs from anticipated extensions of credit. The Company s liquidity position is monitored daily by management to maintain a level of liquidity that can efficiently meet current needs and is evaluated for both current and longer term needs as part of the asset/liability management process. The Company measures total liquidity through cash and cash equivalents, securities available-for-sale, mortgage loans held for sale, other loans and investment securities maturing within one year, less securities pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements, public deposits and other purposes, and less any outstanding Federal funds purchased. These liquidity sources totaled $690.6, $781.2, and $585.1 million at December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 respectively. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Bank include the capacity to borrow funds through established short-term lines of credit with various correspondent banks and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these additional liquidity sources. The Company s available for sale investment securities totaled $493.4 million at December 31, 2012. Investments have been made primarily in short-term mortgage-backed securities providing the Company a strong source of liquidity from the monthly pass through of principal and interest payments. These securities can be pledged for borrowing purposes or can be sold to accommodate liquidity needs. Capital The assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance, changing competitive conditions and economic forces, and the overall level of growth. The adequacy of the Company s current and future capital is monitored by management on an ongoing basis. Management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses. Both the Company s and the Bank s capital levels continue to meet regulatory requirements. The primary indicators relied on by bank regulators in measuring the capital position are the Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital, and leverage ratios. Tier 1 capital consists of common and qualifying preferred stockholders equity, less goodwill, and for the Company includes certain minority interests relating to bank subsidiary issued shares, and a limited amount of restricted core capital elements. Restricted core capital elements include qualifying cumulative preferred stock interests, certain minority interests in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities. For 2011 and 2010, all of the $71 million in preferred stock interests issued to the Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program qualify as Tier 1 capital. Total risk-based capital consists of Tier 1 capital, qualifying subordinated debt, and a portion of the allowance for loan losses, and for the Company, a limited amount of excess restricted core capital elements. Risk-based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio compares Tier 1 capital to total average assets. The Bank s Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.82% at December 31, 2012, compared to 14.21% at December 31, 2011, and its total risk-based capital ratio was 14.08% at December 31, 2012, compared to 15.47% at December 31, 2011. These ratios are in excess of the mandated minimum requirement of 4.00% and 8.00%, respectively. The Bank s leverage ratio was 10.03% at December 31, 2012, compared to 11.40% at December 31, 27 2011. The Company s Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and leverage ratio was 13.25%, 14.51%, and 10.29%, respectively, at December 31, 2012, compared to 14.55%, 15.81%, and 11.61%, respectively, at December 31, 2011. The decreases in these capital ratios in 2012 are due mostly to the repayment of the $71 million in preferred stock in December 2012. Both the Company s and Bank s capital positions reflect proceeds from the issuance of a total of $65 million in trust preferred securities. The ability of the Company to continue to maintain its overall asset size, or to grow, is dependent on its earnings and the ability to obtain additional funds for contribution to the Bank s capital, through earnings, borrowing, the sale of additional common stock, or through the issuance of additional trust preferred securities or other qualifying securities. In the event that the Company is unable to obtain additional capital for the Bank on a timely basis, the growth of the Company and the Bank may be curtailed, and the Company and the Bank may be required to reduce their level of assets in order to maintain compliance with regulatory capital requirements. Under those circumstances net income and the stockholders equity may be adversely affected. Guidance by the federal banking regulators provides that banks which have concentrations in construction, land development or commercial real estate loans (other than loans for majority owner occupied properties) would be expected to maintain higher levels of risk management and, potentially, higher levels of capital. It is possible that we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain as a result of our levels of acquisition, development and construction loans and commercial real estate loans, which may require us to obtain additional capital. Under currently effective regulatory capital guidelines, as long as the Company has total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion, the trust preferred securities that were issued before May 19, 2010 can be counted as Tier 1 capital at the holding company level. Together with other restricted core capital elements, up to 25% of total capital (net of goodwill), and any excess may be counted as Tier 2 capital, subject to limitation. At December 31, 2012, trust preferred securities represented 21.1% of the Company s Tier 1 capital and 19.1% of its total risk-based capital. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Regulation, Supervision and Governmental Policy section beginning on page 93 for further information regarding trust preferred securities. Capital Issuances. On March 31, 2011, the Company issued 426,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $5.87 per share in a registered direct placement with a Company director for total gross proceeds of approximately $2.5 million. In addition, the Company issued to the investor, warrants exercisable for shares of common stock, which, if fully exercised, would provide an additional $4.8 million in gross proceeds to the Company. The warrants each had an exercise price of $5.62 per share. The Series A warrants, exercisable for a total of 426,000 shares of common stock, were exercisable for a period of seven months following the closing date. The Series B warrants, also exercisable for a total of 426,000 shares of common stock, were exercisable for a period of twelve months following the closing date. The 426,000 Series A warrants were exercised in full before they expired. In March 2012, the remaining 426,000 Series B warrants were also exercised. On September 29, 2010, the Company issued 1,904,766 shares of its common stock at a price of $5.25 per share in a registered direct placement with several institutional investors for total gross proceeds of $10.0 million. In addition, the Company issued to the investors warrants exercisable for shares of common stock. The warrants each had an exercise price of $6.00 per share, which represented a 14.3% premium to the offering price of the shares of common stock sold in the registered direct placement. The Series A warrants were exercisable through April 30, 2011, and 130,851 were exercised as of that date. The 952,383 Series B warrants originally were to expire on September 29, 2011, but on September 27, 2011, the expiration date of 904,764 of the Series B Warrants was extended to January 27, 2012, with 47,619 warrants having been exercised prior to the warrant extension. Following the extension, during the fourth quarter of 2011, an additional 47,619 Series B warrants were exercised. During January 2012, the remaining 857,155 Series B warrants were exercised. As noted above, during 2008, the Company accepted an investment by Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. In connection with that investment, the Company entered into and consummated a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Treasury, pursuant to which the Company issued 71,000 shares of the Company s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A ( Series A Preferred Stock ), having a liquidation amount per share equal to $1,000, for a total purchase price of $71.0 million. The Series A Preferred Stock paid cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per year for the first five years, and thereafter would have paid dividends at a rate of 9% per year. The Series A Preferred Stock was non-voting, except in limited circumstances. Prior to the third anniversary of issuance, unless the Company has redeemed all of the Series A Preferred Stock or the Treasury has transferred all of the Series A Preferred 28 Stock to a third party, the consent of the Treasury was required for the Company to commence paying a cash common stock dividend or repurchase its common stock or other equity or capital securities, other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice and certain other circumstances specified in the Purchase Agreement. On December 11, 2012, the Company announced that it had repurchased all of the $71.0 million in preferred stock that was issued to the Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. In connection with the purchase of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Treasury was issued a warrant (the Warrant ) to purchase 2,696,203 shares of the Company s common stock at an initial exercise price of $3.95 per share. The Warrant provides for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares of the common stock issuable upon exercise pursuant to customary anti-dilution provisions, such as upon stock splits or distributions of securities or other assets to holders of the common stock, and upon certain issuances of the common stock (or securities exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, common stock) at or below 90% of the market price of the common stock on the trading day prior to the date of the agreement on pricing such securities. The Warrants expire ten years from the date of issuance. If the Company redeems the Series A Preferred Stock in full prior to exercise of the Warrant, the Warrant will be liquidated based upon the then current fair market value of the common stock. The Treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant. As of December 31, 2012, the warrant issued to the Treasury to purchase shares of the Company s common stock remains outstanding. In 2013, the Company intends to negotiate with the Treasury to repurchase this warrant, subject to the regulatory approval Please refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the issuance of $25.0 million of trust preferred securities and warrants to purchase 1.5 million shares to certain directors and executive officers of the Company. Contractual Obligations The Company has entered into certain contractual obligations including long term debt, operating leases and obligations under service contracts. The following table summarizes the Company s contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2012: TABLE 17: CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Payments Due-By Period (Dollars in thousands) Total Within One Year Years Two and Three Years Four and Five After Five Years Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Federal funds purchased $ 250,718 $ 175,718 $ 25,000 $ $ 50,000 Other borrowed funds 7,000 7,000 Trust preferred securities 65,000 65,000 Operating leases 24,210 4,272 7,092 4,172 8,674 Data processing services 3,939 1,341 2,598 Total contractual cash obligations $ 350,867 $ 181,331 $ 41,690 $ 4,172 $ 123,674 The obligation for data processing services represents estimates of minimum required payments for the periods. Of the $50.0 million of trust preferred securities shown as due after 5 years, $15.0 million is subject to redemption, at par, at the Company s option, on any semi-annual distribution payment date. The table does not reflect deposit liabilities entered into in the ordinary course of the Company s banking business. At December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately $1.6 billion of demand and savings deposits, exclusive of interest, which have no stated maturity or payment date. The Company also had approximately $628.9 million of time deposits, exclusive of interest, the maturity distribution of which is set forth in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information about the Company s deposit obligations, see Net Interest Income and Deposits above. The trust preferred securities exclude $1.8 million of capital notes held by the trusts that relate to the common securities of the issuing trusts, all of which are owned by the Company. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the trust preferred capital notes. 29 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees which would impact the Company s liquidity and capital resources to the extent customers accept and or use these commitments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the nature, business purpose and elements of risk involved with these off-balance sheet arrangements. With the exception of these off-balance sheet arrangements, and the Company s obligations in connection with its trust preferred securities, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources, that is material to investors. For further information, see Notes 15 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves various risks. The following is a summary of certain risks identified by us as affecting our business. You should carefully consider the risk factors listed below, as well as other cautionary statements made in this Annual Report, and risks and uncertainties which we may identify in our other reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other public announcements. These risk factors may cause our future earnings to be lower or our financial condition to be less favorable than we expect. In addition, other risks of which we are not aware, which relate to the banking and financial services industries in general, or which we do not believe are material, may cause earnings to be lower, or hurt our future financial condition. You should read this section together with the other information in this Annual Report. The current economic environment poses significant challenges for us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We currently are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, both nationally and in the local markets that we serve. Financial institutions continue to be affected by sharp declines in the value of financial instruments and real estate, and while we continue to take steps to reduce our market and credit risk exposure, we nonetheless are affected by these issues in view of our retaining a securities portfolio, and portfolios of multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, acquisition, development and construction loans, and commercial and industrial loans. Continued declines in the value of our investment securities could result in our recording additional losses on the other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) of securities, which would reduce our earnings and, therefore, our capital. Continued declines in real estate values and home sales, and an increase in the financial stress on borrowers stemming from an uncertain economic environment, including rising unemployment, could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers, which could adversely impact the repayment of the loans we have made. The overall deterioration in economic conditions also could subject us, and the financial services industry, to increased regulatory scrutiny. In addition, a further deterioration in local economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, an increase in problem assets and foreclosures, and a decline in the value of the collateral for our loans, which could reduce our customers borrowing power. Furthermore, a further deterioration in local economic conditions could drive the level of loan losses beyond the level we have provided for in our allowance for loan losses, which could necessitate an increase in our provision for loans losses, which, in turn, would reduce our earnings and capital. Additionally, the demand for our products and services could be reduced, which would adversely impact our liquidity and the level of revenues we generate. Our concentration of real estate related loans in our market area could result in higher than normal risk of loan defaults and losses. We have a substantial amount of loans secured by real estate in the Northern Virginia/Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and substantially all of our loans are to borrowers in that area. We also have a significant amount of acquisition, development and construction loans. At December 31, 2012, 87.5% of our total loans were secured by real estate, primarily commercial real estate. Of these loans, $282.0 million, or 12.90% of total loans, were acquisition, development and construction loans. An additional 11.9% of total loans were commercial and industrial loans which are not secured by real estate. These loans have a higher risk of default than other types of loans, such as well underwritten conforming single family residential mortgage loans. In addition, the repayments of these loans often depend on the successful operation of a business or the sale or development of the underlying property, and as a result 30 are more likely to be adversely affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. These concentrations expose us to the risk that adverse developments in the real estate market, or in the general economic conditions in the Northern Virginia/Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, could increase the levels of nonperforming loans and charge-offs, and reduce loan demand. In that event, we would likely experience lower earnings or losses. Additionally, if, for any reason, economic conditions in our market area deteriorate, or there is significant volatility or weakness in the economy or any significant sector of the area s economy, our ability to develop our business relationships may be diminished, the quality and collectability of our loans may be adversely affected, the value of collateral may decline and loan demand may be reduced. Additionally, under guidance from the banking agencies, we may be required to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain, and to employ greater risk management efforts, as a result of our real estate concentrations. Commercial real estate loans and acquisition, development and construction loans also generally have larger balances than single family mortgage loans and other consumer loans. Because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial real estate loans and acquisition, development and construction loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in our provision for loan losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Further increases to our nonperforming assets, troubled debt restructurings and other impaired loans that are performing will have an adverse effect on our earnings. Our nonperforming assets (which consist of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned ( OREO ) and our troubled debt restructurings and other impaired loans, which are currently performing, totaled $172.9 million at December 31, 2012. Our nonperforming assets, troubled debt restructurings and other impaired loans adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or OREO. We must establish an allowance for loan losses that reserves for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable through current period provisions for loan losses. From time to time, we also write down the value of properties in our OREO portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to OREO. Troubled debt restructurings may be classified as nonaccrual loans if the relationship was nonaccrual status prior to restructuring or if payments on the troubled debt restructuring are not made on a current basis. If any of our current or future troubled debt restructurings become nonperforming, we will not record interest income on such loans and, as a result, our earnings will be adversely affected. The resolution of nonperforming assets, troubled debt restructurings and other impaired loans requires the active involvement of management, which can distract management from its overall supervision of operations and other income producing activities. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance for loan losses accordingly, which will have an adverse effect on our earnings. Our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to absorb actual losses or if we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses. Experience in the banking industry indicates that a portion of our loans will become delinquent, that some of our loans may only be partially repaid or may never be repaid and that we may experience other losses for reasons beyond our control. Further, despite our underwriting criteria and historical experience, we may be particularly susceptible to losses due to: (1) the geographic concentration of our loans, (2) the concentration of higher risk loans, such as commercial real estate and acquisition, development and construction loans, and (3) the relative lack of seasoning of certain of our loans. While totals of both nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings have decreased from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2012, we continue to have elevated levels of impaired loans that are performing. The combined levels remain in excess of our historical levels and are concentrated in ADC, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. As a result, our provision and allowance for loan losses, as well as our level of charge-offs, remain higher than historical levels. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our provision for loan losses totaled $14.8 million. Net charge-offs for the year ending December 31, 2012, amounted to $20.8 million, compared to $28.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. As a result of these provisions, the total allowance for loan losses decreased $6.0 million, or 12.2%, from $48.7 million at December 31, 2011, to $42.8 million at December 31, 2012. As a percent of total loans, the allowance has decreased from 2.24% as of December 30, 2011, to 1.95% as of 31 December 31, 2012. Although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb any inherent losses in our loan portfolio, these estimates of loan losses are necessarily subjective and their accuracy depends on the outcome of future events. If we need to make significant and unanticipated increases in our loss allowance in the future, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected at that time. While we strive to carefully monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become nonperforming, at any time there are loans included in the portfolio that will result in losses, but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem loans. We cannot be sure that we will be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become nonperforming assets, or that we will be able to limit losses on those loans that are identified. Furthermore, bank regulators may require us to make a provision for loan losses or otherwise recognize further loan charge-offs following their periodic review of our loan portfolio, our underwriting procedures and our allowance for loan losses. As a result, future additions to the allowance may be necessary, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in interest rates and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse impact on our earnings. Our operating income and net income depend to a great extent on our net interest margin, which is the difference between the interest yields we receive on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest rates we pay on interest-bearing deposits and other liabilities. The net interest margin is affected by changes in market interest rates, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including competition, general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Federal Reserve Board ). We attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, but interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. As a result, a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations. The results of our interest rate sensitivity simulation models depend upon a number of assumptions which may prove to be not accurate. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our interest rate risk. Increases in market rates and adverse changes in the local residential real estate market, the general economy or consumer confidence would likely have a significant adverse impact on our non-interest income, as a result of reduced demand for residential mortgage loans that we make on a pre-sold basis. Adverse changes in the real estate market in our market area could also have an adverse affect on our cost of funds and net interest margin, as we have a large amount of non-interest bearing demand deposits related to real estate sales and development. While we expect that we would be able to replace the liquidity provided by these deposits, the replacement funds would likely be more costly, which would negatively impact our earnings. Additionally, changes in applicable law, if enacted, could have a significant negative effect on our net interest income, net income, net interest margin, and our return on assets and return on equity. We may not be able to maintain our historical growth rate, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth, or grow at all. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory considerations and competition, may impede our rate of growth and our ability to expand, or may make future growth or expansion less profitable or more expensive. If we experience a significant decrease in our rate of growth as compared to our historic rate of growth, our income, or our rate of income growth, may decline, our capacity to absorb any additional losses resulting from, or loan loss provisions related to, declining loan quality may be diminished, and we may not be able to maintain or reduce our expense levels and efficiency ratio, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 32 Real estate market volatility and future changes in our disposition strategies could result in net proceeds that differ significantly from our OREO fair value appraisals. At December 31, 2012, our OREO portfolio totaled $12.3 million. Our OREO portfolio consists of properties that we obtained through foreclosure or through an in-substance foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. Properties in our OREO portfolio are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loans for which the properties previously served as collateral or the fair value, which represents the estimated sales price of the properties on the date acquired less estimated selling costs. Generally, in determining fair value an orderly disposition of the property is assumed, except where a different disposition strategy is expected. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of OREO property. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, we may utilize alternative sale strategies other than orderly disposition as part of our OREO disposition strategy, such as immediate liquidation sales. In this event, as a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from such sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of our OREO properties. Changes in the fair value or ratings downgrades of our securities may reduce our stockholders equity, net earnings or regulatory capital ratios. At December 31, 2012, our investment securities portfolio, totaling $493.4 million, was classified as available-for-sale. The estimated fair value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease depending on market conditions. Our securities portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate securities. We increase or decrease stockholders equity by the amount of the change in the unrealized gain or loss (difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of the related tax benefit, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders equity, as well as book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold, the decrease may be recovered over the life of the securities. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other-than-temporary. Factors that we consider in our analysis include, but are not limited to, the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the security, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, whether the decline appears to be related to issuer conditions or general market or industry conditions, our intent and ability to retain the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value and the likelihood of any near-term fair value recovery. We generally view changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary, which is consistent with our experience. If we deem such decline to be other-than-temporary related to credit losses, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings as a component of non-interest income. We have in prior financial periods recorded OTTI charges. We continue to monitor our securities portfolio as part of our ongoing OTTI evaluation process. No assurance can be given that we will not need to recognize additional OTTI charges related to securities in the future. The capital that we are required to hold for regulatory purposes is impacted by, among other things, the securities ratings. Therefore, ratings downgrades on our securities may have a material adverse effect on our risk-based regulatory capital. Turmoil in the financial markets may make it more difficult for the bank to meet its liquidity needs. Over the past few years, financial markets experienced periods of unprecedented pressure associated with the declining value of residential real estate, and deleveraging by investors in mortgage related securities. The turmoil in the financial markets has also caused many depositors to seek safety in government securities, resulting in liquidity challenges for all banks. Our bank responded to these challenges by promoting participation in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service program and by supplementing the Bank s liquidity sources with retained earnings, returns from our investment securities portfolio and proceeds from strategic capital raises. However, should turmoil in the markets return, the bank may be forced to pay higher interest rates to obtain deposits and meet the needs of its depositors and borrowers, resulting in reduced net interest income. 33 Loss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers. Our business is primarily relationship-driven in that many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships. Loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor. While we believe our relationships with our key employees are good, we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with our organization. Loss of such key personnel, should they enter into employment relationships with our competitors, could result in the loss of some of our customers. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete with others for business. The Northern Virginia/Washington, D.C. metropolitan area in which we operate is considered highly attractive from an economic and demographic viewpoint, and is a highly competitive banking market. We compete for loans, deposits, and investment dollars with numerous regional and national banks, online divisions of out-of-market banks, and other community banking institutions, as well as other kinds of financial institutions and enterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage brokers, and private lenders. Many competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and operate under less stringent regulatory environments. The differences in resources and regulations may make it harder for us to compete profitably, reduce the rates that we can earn on loans and investments, increase the rates we must offer on deposits and other funds, and adversely affect our overall financial condition and earnings. System failures, interruptions or breaches of security could adversely impact our business operations and financial condition. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, deposits and loans. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions and security breaches, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, any compromise of our security systems could deter customers from using our website and our online banking service, both of which involve the transmission of confidential information. Although we rely on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we outsource certain of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. The occurrence of any systems failure, interruption or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to respond to rapidly changing technology or meet the needs of our customers. The provision of financial products and services has become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so on our part could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations. 34 We are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny with respect to bank secrecy and anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. In recent years, regulators have intensified their focus on the USA PATRIOT Act s anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements. There is also increased scrutiny of our compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, we have been required to revise policies and procedures and install new systems. We cannot be certain that the policies, procedures and systems we have in place are flawless. Therefore, there is no assurance that in every instance we are in full compliance with these requirements. Our inability to comply with these requirements may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in government regulation will significantly affect our business and may result in higher costs and lower profitability. The banking industry is heavily regulated. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance funds and depositors, not stockholders. The holding company and the Bank are regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, the Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. The burden imposed by federal and state regulations puts banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and leasing companies. Changes in the laws, regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may increase our costs of doing business or otherwise adversely affect us and create competitive advantages for others. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change, and we cannot predict the ultimate effect of these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition. Federal economic and monetary policy may also affect our ability to attract deposits and other funding sources, make loans and investments, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads. Substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control and anti-takeover provisions of Virginia law may make it more difficult for you to receive a change in control premium. With certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be acting in concert from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. There are comparable prior approval requirements for changes in control under Virginia law. Also, Virginia corporate law contains several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors, and may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. The number of shares owned by our directors and executive officers could make it more difficult to obtain approval for some matters submitted to stockholder vote, including mergers and acquisitions. Our directors and executive officers and their affiliates own approximately 17.2% of the outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2012. By voting against a proposal submitted to stockholders, the directors and executive officers, as a group, may be able to make approval more difficult for proposals requiring the vote of stockholders, such as some mergers, share exchanges, asset sales, and amendments to our Articles of Incorporation. The results of any such vote may be contrary to the desires or interests of the public stockholders. 35 In connection with the proposed merger between the Company and United Bankshares, each of the Company s directors have signed a support agreement that requires each director, in each director s capacity as a stockholder of the Company and except in certain limited circumstances, to vote his shares in favor of the proposed merger. The Dodd-Frank Act could increase the Company s regulatory compliance burden and associated costs, place restrictions on certain products and services, and limit its future capital raising strategies. A wide range of regulatory initiatives directed at the financial services industry have been proposed. One of those initiatives, the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a sweeping overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States and mandates significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape that will impact all financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank. When fully implemented, the Dodd-Frank Act will likely increase the Company s regulatory compliance burden and may have a material adverse effect on the Company by increasing the costs associated with regulatory examinations and compliance measures. Among the Dodd Frank Act s significant regulatory changes, the Act creates a new financial consumer protection agency that could impose new regulations and include its examiners in routine regulatory examinations conducted by the Federal Reserve. This agency, named the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Act s prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices, which may directly impact the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Company and the Bank. This agency s broad rulemaking authority includes identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any consumer financial transaction or consumer financial product or service. Although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has jurisdiction over banks with $10 billion or greater in assets, rules, regulations and policies issued by the Bureau may also apply to the Company or the Bank by virtue of the adoption of such policies and best practices by the Federal Reserve, FDIC or Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Financial Institutions. The costs and limitations related to this additional regulatory agency and the limitations and restrictions that will be placed upon the Company with respect to its consumer product and service offerings have yet to be determined. However, these costs, limitations and restrictions may produce significant, material effects on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Dodd-Frank Act also increases regulatory supervision and examination of bank holding companies and their banking and non-banking subsidiaries. These and other regulations included in the Dodd-Frank Act could increase the Company s regulatory compliance burden and costs, restrict the financial products and services the Bank can offer to its customers and restrict the Company s ability to generate revenues from non-banking operations. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies, which could limit the Company s future capital strategies. The recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase interest expense. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the prohibition on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts was repealed. As a result, beginning on July 21, 2011, financial institutions could commence offering interest on demand deposits. Although the Company cannot be certain what rates other institutions may offer, the Company expects the impact of offering interest on demand deposits to remain minimal as long as the low rate environment continues and short term rates remain near zero. The Company maintained $12.8 million in business interest checking balances at December 31, 2012, which had a minimal impact on the Company s interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012. When rates begin to increase, however, the Company s interest expense may increase and the net interest margin may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s and the Bank s business, financial condition and results of operations. Our deposit insurance premiums could increase in the future, which may adversely affect our future financial performance. The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF ) at a certain level. Economic conditions since 2008 have increased the rate of bank failures and expectations for further bank failures, requiring the FDIC to make payments for insured deposits from the DIF and prepare for future payments from the DIF. 36 On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted final rules to implement changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to the FDIC assessment rules effective April 1, 2011. These changes are effective; a depository institution s deposit insurance assessment are now calculated based on the institution s total assets less tangible equity, rather than the previous base of total deposits. These changes did not increase the Company s FDIC insurance assessments for comparable asset and deposit levels. However, if the Bank s asset size increases or the FDIC takes other actions to replenish the DIF, the Bank s FDIC insurance premiums could increase. The fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the net interest margin. It also can materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities. Its policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in Federal Reserve Board policies and our regulatory environment generally are beyond our control, and we are unable to predict what changes may occur or the manner in which any future changes may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Trading in our common stock has been relatively inactive. As a result, stockholders may not be able to quickly and easily sell their common stock. Although our common stock is listed on Nasdaq, and a number of brokers offer to make a market in our common stock on a regular basis, trading volume to date has been relatively inactive, averaging approximately 40,778 shares per day during the year ended December 31, 2012. Although trading in our common stock has increased substantially during the first quarter of 2013, there can be no assurance that a consistently active and liquid market for the common stock will develop or continue. Accordingly, you may find it difficult to sell a significant number of shares at the prevailing market price. Our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock and to repurchase any shares of our common stock is highly restricted. We have no recent history of paying cash dividends, other than repurchases of fractional shares issued in connection with stock splits or stock dividends. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, or repurchase shares, is limited by state and federal law and regulation, and is further limited by the merger agreement entered into by the Company and United Bankshares, Inc. Further, we cannot pay any dividends on our common stock, or acquire any shares of our common stock, if any distribution on our trust preferred securities is in arrears. In light of the foregoing restrictions, and until the Company changes its dividend, capital and growth strategies, it is unlikely that we will pay any dividends on our common stock or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the near future. Risks Related to the Merger with United Bankshares, Inc. ( UBSI ) Termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact us. If the Agreement between the Company and UBSI (for the purposes of these Risk Factors, the Merger Agreement ) is terminated and the parties fail to consummate the Merger, there may be various negative consequences to the Company and the Bank. For example, our businesses may have been adversely affected by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to pay the equivalent or greater consideration than that which UBSI has agreed to pay with respect to the Merger. In addition, under certain circumstances, the termination of the Merger Agreement may require us to pay to UBSI a termination fee in the amount of $20.0 million. 37 We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending. Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us and our business. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with the Company and the Bank to seek to change existing business relationships. Retention of certain employees by the Company and the Bank may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Bank. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with our organization, our business following the Merger could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, we have agreed to operate our business in the ordinary course prior to closing. Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected. UBSI and the Company have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate independently. The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of UBSI with ours. To realize these anticipated benefits, after the completion of the Merger, UBSI expects to integrate our business into its own. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect UBSI s ability to successfully conduct its business in the markets in which we now operate, which could have an adverse effect on UBSI s financial results and the value of its common stock. If UBSI experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause the Bank to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from the Bank and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between UBSI and the Company will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of the Company, the Bank and UBSI during this transition period and for an undetermined period after consummation of the Merger. Our ability to complete the Merger with UBSI is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from regulatory agencies which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the Merger to be abandoned. Before the Merger may be completed, we must obtain various approvals or consents from the Federal Reserve Board and various bank regulatory and other authorities. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger. Although UBSI and the Company do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of UBSI following the Merger. There can be no assurance as to whether the regulatory approvals will be received, the timing of those approvals, or whether any conditions will be imposed. Fluctuations in market prices of UBSI common stock will affect the value that our stockholders receive for their shares of our common stock. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, our stockholders will receive 0.5442 shares of UBSI common stock for each share of the Company s common stock (such ratio, the Exchange Ratio ). The market price of the UBSI common stock may vary from its price on the date immediately prior to the public announcement of the Merger as a result of a variety of factors, including, among other things, changes in UBSI s businesses, operations and prospects, regulatory considerations and general market and economic conditions. Many of these factors are beyond the control of UBSI or the Company. As a result of the fixed number of shares of UBSI common stock to be issued in the merger, the market value of the shares of UBSI common stock that our stockholders receive in the merger will decline correspondingly with any declines in the market price of UBSI common stock prior to and as of the date the merger consideration is paid, subject to the conditions and limitations discussed in the following paragraph. As addressed in more detail in the Merger Agreement, we may terminate the Merger Agreement by a vote of a majority of our board of directors if (a) the average closing price per share (calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement) of UBSI common stock declines 20 percent from the closing price per share on the last trading day prior to 38 publicly announcing the Merger Agreement and (b) the percentage decline in the average closing price per share of UBSI common stock is at least 15 percent greater than the percentage decline in the closing price of the Nasdaq Bank Index over the same period; except provided as follows. Even if the conditions in (a) and (b) are met, UBSI may adjust the Exchange Ratio as provided in the Merger Agreement to increase the consideration received by our stockholders in the Merger, and if such adjustment is made our right to terminate the Merger Agreement will be extinguished. Because the price of UBSI common stock and the Nasdaq Bank Index will fluctuate prior to the Merger, and because in certain circumstances UBSI has the right to adjust the consideration received in the Merger by our stockholders, we cannot assure our stockholders of the market value or number of shares of UBSI common stock that they will receive in the merger. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2012, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures will detect or uncover every situation involving the failure of persons within the Company or its subsidiary to disclose material information required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports. 39 MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the Company is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management believes that internal controls over financial reporting, which are subject to scrutiny by management and the Company s internal auditors, support the integrity and reliability of the financial statements. Management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control system, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. In addition, because of changes in conditions and circumstances, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Management assessed the effectiveness of Company s system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. This assessment was conducted based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ( COSO ) of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework . Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. Management s assessment concluded that there were no material weaknesses within the Company s internal control structure. The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, has been audited by Yount, Hyde Barbour, P.C., the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Yount, Hyde Barbour, P.C. s attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting appears on pages 41 and 42 hereof. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2012, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 40 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. Arlington, Virginia We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 14, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting. Winchester, Virginia March 14, 2013 41 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. Arlington, Virginia We have audited Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 42 In our opinion, Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 of Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated March 14, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion.

Financial Statements Note 1. Nature of Banking Activities and Significant Accounting Policies Business Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. (the Company ) is the holding company for Virginia Commerce Bank (the Bank ). The Bank is a full-service community bank that provides loan and deposit products to commercial and retail customers in the Washington Metropolitan Area, with the primary emphasis on Northern Virginia. The loan portfolio is generally collateralized by assets of the customers and is expected to be re-paid from cash flows or proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers. Pending Merger with United Bankshares, Inc. After the close of business on January 29, 2013, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Agreement ) with United Bankshares, Inc. ( United ). In accordance with the Agreement, the Company will merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of United (the Merger ). At the effective time of the Merger, the Company will cease to exist and the wholly-owned subsidiary of United shall survive and continue to exist as a Virginia corporation. The Agreement provides that at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to received 0.5442 shares of United common stock, par value $2.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided in the Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, the Company s outstanding stock options and trust preferred warrants will be converted into options to purchase United s common stock and warrants to purchase United common stock. In addition, the warrant held by the United State Department of Treasury to purchase common stock of the Company will be converted into a warrant to purchase common stock of United. After the effective time of the Merger, the Bank, will merge with and into United Bank, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of United (the Bank Merger ). United Bank will survive the Bank Merger and continue to exist as a Virginia banking corporation. Under the Agreement and subject to certain exceptions, the Company agreed to conduct its business in the ordinary course while the Merger is pending and, except as permitted under the Agreement, refrain from taking certain specific actions without the consent of United. Completion of the Merger is subject to approval by the shareholders of each of the Company and United, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, the Bank, VCBI Capital Trust II, VCBI Capital Trust III, VCBI Capital Trust IV, Northeast Land and Investment Company, Tombstone Land Company, Canova Land and Investment Company and Virginia Commerce Insurance Agency L.L.C. In consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC or Codification ) 810 requires that the Company no longer eliminate through consolidation the equity investments in VCBI Capital Trust II, III and IV, by the parent company, Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc, which approximated $2.0 million at December 31, 2012. The subordinated debt of the trusts is reflected as a liability of the Company and the common securities of the trusts as an other asset. Risks and Uncertainties In its normal course of business, the Company encounters two significant types of risk: economic and regulatory. There are three main components of economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more rapidly or on a different basis than its interest-earning assets. Credit risk is the risk of default on the Company s loan portfolio that results from the borrowers inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments. Market risk reflects changes in the value of collateral underlying loans receivable and the valuation of real estate held by the Company. 50 The determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation allowance on other real estate owned is based on estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the economic environment and market conditions. A worsening or protracted economic decline, a delayed or weakening economic recovery, or a substantial increase in interest rates could increase the likelihood of losses due to credit and market risks and could create the need for substantial increases to the allowance for loan losses. The Company is subject to the regulations of various regulatory agencies, which can change significantly from year to year. In addition, the Company undergoes periodic examinations by regulatory agencies, which may subject it to further changes based on the regulators judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Securities Investments in debt securities with readily determinable fair values are classified as either held-to-maturity (HTM ) or available-for-sale ( AFS ) based on management s intent. Equity investments in the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and Community Bankers Bank are separately classified as restricted securities and are carried at cost. AFS securities are carried at estimated fair value with the corresponding unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. Gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity based on management s intent and the Company s ability, at the time of purchase, to hold such securities to maturity. These securities are carried at amortized cost. Transfers made from the held-to-maturity investment portfolio to available-for-sale investment portfolio, are recorded at fair market value on the day of transfer and any unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2012, all of the Company s securities are classified as available-for-sale. Impairment of securities occurs when the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost. For debt securities, impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recognized in its entirety in net income if either (i) the Company intends to sell the security or (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If, however, the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more-than-likely that it will be required to sell the security before recovery, the Company must determine what portion of the impairment is attributable to a credit loss, which occurs when the amortized cost of the security exceeds the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security. If there is no credit loss, there is no other-than-temporary impairment. If there is a credit loss, other-than-temporary impairment exists, and the credit loss must be recognized in net income and the remaining portion of impairment must be recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities carried at cost as restricted securities, impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary based on the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery of fair value. Other-than-temporary impairment of an equity security results in a write-down that must be included in income. Management regularly reviews each security for other-than-temporary impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which costs exceeds market price, the duration of the market decline, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, the best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from debt securities, the Company s intention with regard to holding the security to maturity and the likelihood that it would be required to sell the security before recovery. Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market, determined in the aggregate. Market value considers commitment agreements with investors and prevailing market prices. Loans originated by the Company s mortgage banking unit and held for sale to outside investors, are made on a pre-sold basis with servicing rights released. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related mortgage loans sold. Loans The Company grants real estate, commercial and consumer loans to customers. Real estate loans can be to individuals, corporations or other entities and are broken down by class as 1-4 Family Residential Mortgages; Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit; Multi-Family Residential Mortgages; Owner Occupied Non-Farm, Non-Residential Mortgages; Non-Owner Occupied Non-Farm Non-Residential Mortgages; Residential Construction Loans; Commercial Construction Loans, Consumer Loans and Farmland. Commercial loans can be to individuals, corporations and other 51 entities for business purposes and can be lines of credit or term loans. Consumer loans are to individuals, for personal or household purposes and can be lines of credit or installment loans. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is represented by real estate loans. The ability of the Company s debtors to honor their contracts is dependent upon the general economic conditions and real estate climate of the Company s market area. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted for the allowance for loan losses and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the interest method. All loan classes are considered past due upon expiration of the grace period which ranges from 10 to 15 days. Collection action commences after 15 days and loans which remain past due after 60 days are typically referred to legal counsel or a collection agency. The accrual of interest on all classes of real estate, commercial and consumer loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the credit is well-secured and in the process of collection. All classes of loans are typically charged-off no later than 120 days past due unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is established to address potential losses that could occur through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The evaluation also considers the following risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segments: Residential one-to-four family loans carry risks associated with the continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and changes in the value of the collateral. Home equity lines of credit carry risks associated with the continued credit-worthiness of borrowers and changes in the value of the collateral. Residential multi-family loans carry risks associated with the continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and changes in the value of the collateral. Construction loans carry risks that the project will not be finished according to schedule, the project will not be finished according to budget and the value of the collateral may, at any point in time, be less than the principal amount of the loan. Construction loans also bear the risk that the general contractor, who may or may not be a loan customer, may be unable to finish the construction project as planned because of financial pressure unrelated to the project. Commercial mortgage loans carry risks of increased vacancy in the event that tenants of office, retail, warehouse or similar commercial space fail to renew lease terms, and carry risks of diminished values in the event that market interest rate increase. Commercial loans carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business or a real estate project, in addition to other risks associated with the ownership of real estate, because the repayment of these loans may be dependent upon the profitability and cash flows of the business or project. In addition, there is risk associated with the value of collateral other than real estate which may depreciate over time and cannot be appraised with as much precision. 52 Consumer loans carry risks associated with the continued credit-worthiness of the borrower and the value of the collateral (e.g., rapidly-depreciating assets such as automobiles), or lack thereof. Consumer loans are more likely than real estate loans to be immediately adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Farmland loans carry risks associated with changes in the utility of the property for its intended use (i.e. crops, cattle, fruit trees) based upon changes in soil make up and yield, access to water, etc. In certain instances, loan segments are broken down into more detailed descriptions or classes. Residential one-to-four family loan classes are permanent first and second mortgages and home equity loans or lines. Commercial loans classes are owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied loans. Construction loans classes are residential or commercial loans. Our allowance for loan losses has two basic components: the specific allowance and the general allowance. Each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur. The specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for loans identified as impaired. Impairment testing includes consideration of the borrower s overall financial condition, resources and payment record, support available from financial guarantors and the fair market value of collateral. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for real estate and commercial loan classes by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. These factors are combined to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses. When impairment is identified, then a specific reserve may be established based on the Company s calculation of the loss embedded in the individual loan. Large groups of smaller balance, homogeneous loans like consumer lines of credit and installment loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans which meet the criteria for substandard, doubtful and loss are segregated from performing loans within the portfolio. Internally classified loans are then grouped by loan segment (residential one-to-four family, residential multi-family, construction, commercial, commercial real estate, consumer or farmland). The general formula is used to estimate the loss of non-classified loans. These un-criticized loans are also segregated by loan segment and allowance factors are assigned by management based on delinquencies, loss history, trends in volume and terms of loans, effects of changes in lending policy, the experience and depth of management, national and local economic trends, concentrations of credit, quality of the loan review system and the effect of external factors (i.e. competition and regulatory requirements). The factors assigned differ by loan segment. The general allowance recognizes potential losses whose impact on the portfolio has yet to be recognized by a specific allowance. Allowance factors and the overall size of the allowance may change from period to period based on management s assessment of the above described factors and the relative weights given to each factor. See Note 4 for information regarding the allowance for loan losses. Troubled Debt Restructurings In situations where, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial condition, management may grant a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider, the related loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). Management strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify their loan to more affordable terms before their loan reaches nonaccrual status. These modified terms, or concessions, may include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. In cases where borrowers are granted new terms that provide for a reduction of either interest or principal, management measures any impairment on the restructuring as noted above for impaired loans. As of December 31, 2012, TDR s were $43.5 million compared to $52.3 million as of December 31, 2011, a 16.9% decrease. As of December 31, 2012, all TDR loans were performing in accordance with the modified terms. 53 If the loan was on non-accrual at the time of the concession, it is the Company s policy that the restructured loan remain on non-accrual status and perform in accordance with the modified terms for a period of six months. If a troubled debt restructuring is on non-accrual status, it is reported as a non-accrual asset and not as a troubled debt restructuring. All loans reported as troubled debt restructurings accrue interest. Troubled debt restructurings continue to be individually tested for impairment until the loan is fully repaid. Bank Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Land is carried at cost. Furniture, fixtures, equipment and computer software are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, generally from three to seven years; leasehold improvements are depreciated over the term of the respective leases or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvement. Depreciation and amortization are recorded on the straight-line method. Costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of replacing structural parts of major units are considered individually and are expensed or capitalized as the facts dictate. Other Real Estate Owned Other real estate owned, or foreclosed real properties, that have been substantively repossessed or acquired in complete or partial satisfaction of debt, are held for resale, and carried at fair value, net of estimated selling expenses. An appraisal is ordered when the asset is foreclosed upon. The carrying value of a foreclosed asset is immediately adjusted down through a charge to earnings when new information is obtained, including a potentially acceptable offer, the sale of a similar property in the vicinity of one of the Company s assets, and/or a change in the price at which the property is listed. When appropriate, the Company also utilizes the advice of outside consultants and real estate agents with knowledge of the markets where the properties are located to determine the carrying value of foreclosed assets. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between book and tax bases of the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are classified as additional income taxes in the statement of operations. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no liabilities recorded for unrecognized tax benefits. Advertising Cost The Company follows the policy of charging the production costs of advertising to expense as incurred. Total advertising expense was $949 thousand, $975 thousand and $941 thousand in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Use of Estimates In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (or U.S. GAAP ), management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues 54 and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of deferred tax assets, the measurement of stock based compensation, fair value of financial instruments, impairment on securities and other real estate owned. Share-based Compensation Share-based Compensation: Compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock awards issued to participants is based upon the fair value of the award at the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, while the fair value of restricted stock awards is based upon the stock price at the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period for options and the respective period for stock awards. Share-based compensation expense was $583 thousand in 2012, $615 thousand in 2011 and $700 thousand in 2010. Rate Lock Commitments The Company enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loans is determined prior to funding (rate lock commitments). Rate lock commitments on mortgage loans that are intended to be sold are considered to be derivatives. The period of time between issuance of a loan commitment and closing and the sale of the loan generally ranges from thirty to ninety days. The Company protects itself from changes in interest rates through the use of best efforts forward delivery commitments, whereby the Company commits to sell a loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the buyer has assumed interest rate risk on the loan. As a result, the Company is not exposed to losses nor will it realize significant gains related to its rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates. The correlation between the rate lock commitments and the best efforts contracts is very high due to their similarity. Because of this high correlation, no significant gain or loss occurs on the rate lock commitments. Transfers of Financial Assets Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bank put presumptively beyond reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Bank does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, interest bearing deposits in other banks, and Federal funds sold. Generally, Federal funds are sold and purchased for one-day periods. Earnings Per Common Share Basic earnings per common share represent income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflect additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance. Potential common shares that may be issued by the Company relate solely to outstanding stock options and warrants and are determined using the treasury method. Comprehensive Income Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet. Such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income and appear on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 55 Fair Value The Company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities generally measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. Level 1 Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 assets and liabilities generally include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Valuation is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The valuation may be based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. A financial asset s or liability s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2011-03, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860) Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements. The amendments in this ASU remove from the assessment of effective control (1) the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee and (2) the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion. The amendments in this ASU were effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The guidance should be applied prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after the effective date. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. This ASU is the result of joint efforts by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to develop a single, converged fair value framework on how (not when) to measure fair value and what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements. The ASU is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles in U.S. GAAP (Topic 820), with many of the amendments made to eliminate unnecessary wording differences between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The amendments were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 with prospective application. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Presentation of Comprehensive Income. The new guidance amends disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income. The amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income ( OCI ) as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity. All changes in OCI must be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. The guidance does not change the items that must be reported in OCI. The Company adopted this guidance effective 2012, and has elected to present two separate but consecutive financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangible Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The amendments in this ASU permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors related to goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill test described in Topic 56 350. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. Under the amendments in this ASU, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption was permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210) Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. This ASU requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. An entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2011-11 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities that have indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, reported in their financial statements. The amendments in this ASU provide an entity with the option to make a qualitative assessment about the likelihood that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test. The amendments also enhance the consistency of impairment testing guidance among long-lived asset categories by permitting an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to calculate the asset s fair value when testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment. The amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2012-02 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. The amendments in this ASU clarify the scope for derivatives accounted for in accordance with Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset or subject to netting arrangements. An entity is required to apply the amendments for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2013-01 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to present (either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes) the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. In addition, the amendments require a cross-reference to other disclosures currently required for other reclassification items to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period. Public companies should apply these amendments for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2012. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2013-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 57 Note 2. Securities Amortized cost and fair value of the investment securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2012 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized (Losses) Fair Value Available-for-sale: U.S. Government Agency obligations $ 390,075 $ 3,913 $ (1,121 ) $ 392,867 Pooled trust preferred securities 5,126 (4,769 ) 357 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 93,634 6,627 (61 ) 100,200 Total securities available-for-sale $ 488,835 $ 10,540 $ (5,951 ) $ 493,424 December 31, 2011 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized (Losses) Fair Value Available-for-sale: U.S. Government Agency obligations $ 514,961 $ 9,455 $ (429 ) $ 523,987 Pooled trust preferred securities 5,526 56 (5,126 ) 456 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 63,652 4,997 (28 ) 68,621 Total securities available-for-sale $ 584,139 $ 14,508 $ (5,583 ) $ 593,064 Held-to-maturity: U.S. Government Agency obligations $ 3,763 $ 253 $ $ 4,016 Obligations of state and political subdivisions 28,129 2,286 30,415 Total securities held-to-maturity $ 31,892 $ 2,538 $ $ 34,431 During 2012, the Company transferred its held-to-maturity securities portfolio, with an amortized cost of $30.0 million and a fair value of $32.5 million, to its available-for-sale securities portfolio. The amortized cost and fair value of the securities, as of December 31, 2012, by contractual maturity, are shown below (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2012 Amortized Cost Fair Value Available-for-sale: Due within one year $ 481 $ 493 Due after one year through five years 8,422 9,140 Due after five years through ten years 89,446 92,961 Due after ten years 390,486 390,830 Total securities available-for-sale $ 488,835 $ 493,424 The carrying value of securities pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements, certain public deposits, and other purposes were $444.9 million and $392.8 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. An impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary if the Company (1) intends to sell the security, (2) more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost, or (3) does not expect to recover the security s entire amortized cost basis. Provided below is a summary of all securities which were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2012 and 2011, that were evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment. Presently, the Company does not intend to sell any of 58 these securities, does not expect to be required to sell these securities, and expects to recover the entire amortized cost of all the securities. For U.S. Government Agency obligations and obligations of states and political subdivisions, the unrealized losses result from market or interest rate risk, while the unrealized losses pertaining to the pooled trust preferred securities are due to performance and credit ratings, as well as interest rate risk.

This security has a fair value of $15 thousand and a $2.2 million loss recognized in other comprehensive income. Total other than impairment losses on PreTSL XXVI are $2.2 million, of which $1.4 million was recognized in 2010 and $757 thousand was recognized in 2009.

The following table presents a roll-forward of the credit loss component amount of OTTI recognized in earnings: (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2012 Balance, beginning of period $ 4,200 Additions: Initial credit impairments Subsequent credit impairments Reductions: Sale/redemption (2,034 ) Balance, end of period $ 2,166 One trust preferred security, PreTSL VI, was redeemed in the third quarter of 2012 resulting in a gain of $436 thousand, and one trust preferred security, PreTSL X, was sold in the fourth quarter of 2012 resulting in a gain of $37 thousand. Other-than-temporary impairment previously recorded on these securities totaled $2.0 million. Management has evaluated each of these securities for potential impairment under ASC 325 Investments-Other and the most recently issued related guidance, and has reviewed each of the issues collateral participants most recent earnings, capital and loan loss reserve levels, and non-performing loan levels to estimate a future deferral and default rate in basis points for the remaining life of each security. For the quarter ending December 31, 2012, we used a consistent 75 basis points for all PreTSL securities, XXVI and XXVII, for expected deferrals and defaults as a percentage of remaining performing collateral for future periods. In performing a detailed present value cash flow analysis for each security, the deferral rate was treated the same. If this analysis results in a present value of expected cash flows that is less than the book value of a security (that is, a credit loss exists), an OTTI is considered to have occurred. If there is no credit loss, any impairment is considered temporary. The cash flow analysis we performed used discount rates equal to the credit spread at the time of purchase for each security and then added the current 3-month LIBOR forward interest rate curve. The analysis also assumed 15% recoveries on deferrals after two years and prepayments of 1% per year on each security. As of December 31, 2012, performing issuers included 47 out of 69 issuers in PreTSL XXVI, and 33 out of 48 issuers in PreTSL XXVII. Our investment in Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) stock totaled $4.4 million at December 31, 2012. FHLB stock is generally viewed as a long-term investment and as a restricted security, which is carried at cost, because there is no market for the stock, other than FHLBs or member institutions. As of December 31, 2012, the Company s security portfolio included $5.6 million of Federal Reserve Bank Stock and $145 thousand in stock with the Community Bankers Bank. 60 Note 3.

Loans to persons or entities with a strong to acceptable financial condition, adequate collateral margins, adequate cash flow to service long-term debt, adequate liquidity and sound net worth. These entities are profitable now, with projections indicating continued profitability into the foreseeable future. Closely held corporations or businesses where a majority of the profits are withdrawn by the owners or paid in dividends are included in this rating category. Overall, these loans are basically sound. 62 Watch. These loans are characterized by greater than average risk. Borrowers may have marginal cash flow, marginal profitability, or have experienced an unprofitable year and a declining financial condition. The borrower has in the past satisfactorily handled debts with the Bank, but in recent months has either been late, delinquent in making payments, or made sporadic payments. While the Bank continues to be adequately secured, margins have decreased or are decreasing, despite the borrower s continued satisfactory condition. Other characteristics of borrowers in this class may include inadequate credit or financial information. This classification includes loans to established borrowers that are reasonably margined by collateral, but where potential for improvement in financial capacity appears limited. Special Mention. Loans in this category have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deteriorating prospects for the asset or in the institution s credit position at some future date. Other assets especially mentioned ( OAEMs ) are not adversely classified and do not expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Substandard. A loan classified as substandard has a well-defined weakness and is inadequately protected by the sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or the collateral pledged. Distinct loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans, does not necessarily exist in individual assets that are rated substandard. Doubtful. A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in a loan classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. These are poor quality loans in which neither the collateral, if any, nor the financial condition of the borrower presently ensure collectability in full in a reasonable period of time; in fact, there is permanent impairment in the collateral securing the Bank s loan. These loans are in a work-out status and have a defined work-out strategy. Loss. Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. The Bank takes losses in the period in which they become uncollectible. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were $858 thousand and $166 thousand, respectively, in checking account overdrafts that were reclassified on the consolidated balance sheets as loans. Note 4.

Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when the collection of principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, or earlier, if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of 64 the borrower. Loans greater than 90 days past due may remain on accrual status if management determines it has adequate collateral to cover the principal and interest. For those loans that are carried on non-accrual status, payments are first applied to principal outstanding. A loan may be returned to accrual status if the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan and there is reasonable assurance the borrower will continue to make payments as agreed. These policies are applied consistently across our loan portfolio. Included in certain loan categories in the following impaired loans table are troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) that were classified as impaired. A TDR loan is a loan that has been restructured with a modification that could include interest rate modification, deferral of interest or principal or an extension of term. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $7.0 million in real estate construction, $4.3 million in real estate one-to-four family residential, $25.3 million in non-farm non-residential and $6.9 million in commercial that were modified in troubled debt restructurings and considered impaired. At December 31, 2012, all TDRs were performing in accordance with their modified terms, and at December 31, 2011, of the Company s total TDRs of $52.3 million, $50.8 million of TDRs were performing in accordance with their modified terms.

specific reserve analysis on all impaired loans as of December 31, 2012, current third party appraisals were used with respect to approximately 50% of impaired loans to assist with the evaluation of collateral values for the purpose of establishing specific reserves. Other loans predominantly representing smaller individual balances were evaluated based upon current tax assessed values or estimated liquidation value of business assets. When a loan is identified as impaired and collateral dependent, a current evaluation of collateral value via third party appraisal or other valuation methodology is conducted within the calendar quarter of identification when possible but, not less than 90 days after identification. Charge-offs and specific reserves are established upon determination of collateral value. During the interim between identification of an impaired loan and receipt of a current appraisal of the related collateral, specific reserves are established based upon interim methodologies including discounted cash flow analysis, tax assessment values and review of market comparables. Costs of sale are estimated at 10% of value. Partially charged-off loans remain non-performing until such time as a viable restructuring plan is developed. Upon execution of a forbearance agreement including modified terms, an impaired loan will be re-classified from non-performing to a troubled debt restructuring, but will continue to be identified as impaired until the loan is repaid. Impaired loans which do not have a specific reserve are those loans which have been identified to have sufficient collateral coverage, based upon the fair value of collateral, to repay the entire principal balance due from collateral liquidation.

Scheduled maturities of all time deposits at December 31, 2012, are as follows (dollars in thousands): 2013 $ 292,458 2014 96,684 2015 81,108 2016 99,220 2017 56,577 2018 2,857 $ 628,904 Note 7. Securities Sold Under Agreements To Repurchase and Federal Funds Purchased Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as secured borrowings, represent both funds of significant commercial demand deposit customers, which mature one day from the transaction date, and secured transactions with other banks. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $175.7 million in funds from customers and $75.0 million in funds from other banks. Of this $75.0 million, $25.0 million matures on March 22, 2014, and $50.0 million matures on May 2, 2018. Both of these transactions are callable by the other bank on any quarterly interest payment date. At December 31, 2011, customers funds were $188.3 million and the same $75.0 million in funds from other banks were outstanding. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the amount of cash received and are collateralized by securities in the Company s investment securities portfolio. The securities sold under agreement to repurchase related to customers had an average balance of $255.6 million at an average rate of 0.25% for the year ended December 31, 2012, and $125.2 million at an average rate of 0.46% for the same period 2011.

Warrants for 1,500,000 and 3,404,766 shares of common stock were not included in computing earnings per share in 2011 and 2010, respectively, because their effects were also anti-dilutive. Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies The Company leases office space for thirty of its branch locations, its operations, mortgage lending, and construction lending departments. These non-cancellable agreements, which expire through December 2032, in some instances require payment of certain operating charges. Generally, all leases contain renewal options of one to three additional five-year terms. The total minimum lease commitment, adjusted for the effect of annual fixed increases or the Consumer Price Index, at December 31, 2012, is $24.2 million, due as follows (dollars in thousands): Due in the year ending December 31, 2013 $ 4,272 2014 3,902 2015 3,190 2016 2,378 2017 1,794 Thereafter 8,674 The total lease expense was $4.8 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Related Party Transactions The Company has had, and may be expected to have in the future, transactions in the ordinary course of business with executive officers and directors and their immediate families and affiliated companies (commonly referred to as related parties). In management s opinion, these transactions are on the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with others. All loans to executive officers and directors or their related interests are submitted to the Bank s Board of Directors for approval. These loans do not involve more than normal risk of collectability or present any other unfavorable features. The aggregate amount outstanding on such loans at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $34.9 million and $21.0 million, respectively. During 2012, new loans and advances amounted to $14.1 million and repayments of $271 thousand were made. Deposits from related parties held at the Bank as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 amounted to $35.6 and $27.0, respectively.

There were no borrowings as of December 31, 2011. 73 The Company has entered into employment or change of control agreements with several executive officers. The agreements include minimum annual salary commitments and/or change of control provisions. Upon termination, resignation or change in control of the Company, these individuals may receive monetary compensation as set forth in the agreements. Note 12. Share-based Compensation Plans The Company s current plan, approved by stockholders and effective May 2, 2010 (the 2010 Plan ), provides for the grant of share-based awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock, performance units and other awards to directors and employees. The Company has reserved 1.5 million shares of common stock for issuance under the 2010 Plan, which will remain in effect until May 2, 2020. The Company s Personnel and Compensation Committee administers the 2010 Plan and has the authority to determine the terms and conditions of each award thereunder. To date, options granted under the 2010 Plan vest over five years and expire ten years from the grant date. Restricted stock granted under the 2010 Plan to date vests over five years, subject to certain limitations. As of December 31, 2012, there were 269,027 stock options outstanding and 121,421 shares of restricted stock granted under the 2010 Plan. The Company s previous plan, adopted May 29, 1998, and amended and restated in April 2007 (the 1998 Plan ), was a qualified incentive stock option plan, that was shareholder approved, and provided for the granting of options to purchase up to 2,377,158 shares of common stock at a price determined by the Board of Directors at the date of grant, but in any event no less than 100% of the fair market value. Options outstanding prior to April 26, 2010 were granted under the 1998 Plan. Options under the 1998 Plan expire no more than ten years from the grant date. Options granted under the 1998 Plan, through December 31, 2002, vested over three years, while options granted from December 31, 2002 through May 2, 2010, vested over five years. Included in salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, is $583 thousand of share-based compensation expense which is based on the estimated fair value of 121,421 shares of restricted stock granted between January 2010 and December 2012, and 920,376 options granted between January 2007 and December 2012, amortized on a straight-line basis over a five year requisite service period. As of December 31, 2012, there was $1.4 million remaining of total unrecognized compensation expense related to these option and restricted stock awards which will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period. There was $615 thousand and $700 thousand in share-based compensation expense in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Restricted stock awards generally vest in equal installments over five years. The compensation expense associated with these awards is based on the grant date fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. A summary of the nonvested restricted stock activity under the 2010 Plan during the year ended December 31, 2012 is presented below: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Non-vested at the beginning of year 49,998 $ 5.93 Granted 71,423 8.89 Vested (11,206 ) 8.35 Forfeited Non-vested at end of the year 110,215 $ 7.67 We recognized share-based compensation expense associated with shares of restricted stock of $169 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2012. The fair value of each option grant is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and using the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock and the risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company used a 7.2 year expected term based on analysis of past exercise behaviors for 2012, 2011 and 2010. 2012 2011 2010 Expected volatility 33.68% 32.21% 30.59% Expected dividends 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Expected term (in years) 7.2 7.2 7.2 Risk-free rate 1.10% to 1.44% 2.25% to 2.81% 2.04% to 3.50% 74 A summary of option activity under the 2010 Plan and 1998 Plan during the year ended December 31, 2012 is presented below: Options Number of Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value ($000) Outstanding at December 31, 2011 1,696,117 $ 8.95 Granted 84,750 8.59 Exercised (285,951 ) 3.56 Forfeited (32,263 ) 8.64 Outstanding at December 31, 2012 1,462,653 $ 9.99 4.1 years $ 1,230 Exercisable at December 31, 2012 1,128,569 $ 10.92 3.1 years $ 704 The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the years 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $3.28, $2.40 and $2.49, respectively.

Other Borrowed Funds and Lines of Credit The Bank maintains a $450.4 million line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. The interest rate and term of each advance from the line is dependent upon the advance and commitment type. Advances on the line are secured by all of the Bank s qualifying first liens and home equity lines-of-credit on one-to-four unit single-family dwellings. As of December 31, 2012, the book value of these qualifying loans totaled approximately $255.5 million and the amount of available credit using this collateral was $164.9 million. Advances on the line of credit in excess of this amount require pledging of additional assets, including other types of loans and investment securities. As of December 31, 2011, the Bank had $25.0 million in advances outstanding which matured on September 21, 2012. The Bank had a $7.0 million secured borrowing relating to two loan participations to a related party with cash flow priority as of December 31, 2012.

These securities bore a fixed rate of interest of 6.19% until February 23, 2011, at which time they converted to a floating rate, adjusted quarterly, of 142 basis points over three month Libor, which as of March 13, 2013 was 1.71%. These securities became callable at par beginning February 23, 2011. On September 24, 2008, the Company completed a private placement, to its directors and certain executive officers, of $25.0 million of trust preferred securities through a newly formed, wholly-owned, subsidiary trust (VCBI Capital Trust IV) which issued $775 thousand in common equity to the Company. These securities bear a fixed rate of interest of 10.20% and are callable at par beginning September 24, 2013. In connection with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, the Company also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1.5 million shares of common stock to the purchasers. The warrants have a five year term and an exercise price of $6.83 per share. The principal asset of each trust is a similar amount of the Company s junior subordinated debt securities with an approximately 30 year term from issuance and like interest rates to the trust preferred securities. The obligations of the Company with respect to the trust preferred securities constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of each Trust s obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities to the extent set forth in the related guarantees. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the Company may elect from time to time to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debt securities, resulting in a deferral of distribution payments on the related trust preferred securities. If the Company defers interest payments on the junior subordinated debt securities, or otherwise is in default of the obligations in respect to the trust preferred securities, the Company would be prohibited from making dividend payments to its stockholders, and from most purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of the Company s common stock. Under currently effective bank capital regulatory guidelines, the Trust Preferred Securities may be included in Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital adequacy purposes up to 25.0% of Tier 1 capital after its inclusion. The portion of the trust preferred securities not qualifying as Tier 1 capital may be included as part of total qualifying capital in Tier 2 capital, subject to limitations set forth in the bank capital regulatory guidelines. 76 Note 16. Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. A summary of the contract or notional amount of the Company s exposure to off-balance-sheet risk as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 is as follows: (Dollars in thousands) 2012 2011 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Commitments to extend credit $ 16,807 $ 19,820 Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written $ 60,751 $ 41,104 Unfunded lines of credit $ 533,258 $ 478,241 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing commercial properties. Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds certificates of deposit, marketable securities, and business assets as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. The Company originates mortgage loans for sale to secondary market investors subject to contractually specified and limited recourse provisions. In 2012, the Company originated $210.1 million and sold $217.4 million to investors, compared to $155.2 million originated and $149.3 million sold in 2011. Most contracts with investors contain certain recourse language that may vary from 90 days up to one year. In general, the Company may be required to repurchase a previously sold mortgage loan or indemnify the investor if there is major non-compliance with defined loan origination or documentation standards, including fraud, negligence or material misstatement in the loan documents. Repurchase may also be required if necessary governmental loan guarantees are canceled or never issued, or if an investor is forced to buy back a loan after it has been re-sold as part of a loan pool. In addition, the Company may have an obligation to repurchase a loan if the mortgagor has defaulted early in the loan term. The potential default period is approximately twelve months after sale of the loan to the investor. Mortgages subject to recourse are collateralized by single-family residential properties, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or less, or have private mortgage insurance or are insured or guaranteed by an agency of the United States government. At December 31, 2012, the Bank had rate lock commitments to originate and sell mortgage loans amounting to $34.0 million. Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Bank does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligation. 77 Note 17. Concentrations of Credit Risk The Bank does a general banking business, serving the commercial and personal banking needs of its customers. The Bank s market area consists of the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., including Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Loudoun, Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford Counties, the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Fredericksburg, Manassas and Manassas Park, and to some extent the nearby Maryland suburbs and the city of Washington D.C. Substantially all of the Company s loans are made within its market area. The ultimate collectability of the Bank s loan portfolio and the ability to realize the value of any underlying collateral, if needed, are influenced by the economic conditions of the market area. The Company s operating results are therefore closely related to the economic conditions and trends in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were $1.52 billion and $1.54 billion, or 69.2% and 70.7%, respectively of total loans concentrated in commercial real estate. Commercial real estate for purposes of this note includes all construction loans, loans secured by multifamily (5+ family) residential properties and loans secured by non-farm, non-residential properties. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, construction loans represented 12.9% and 15.0% of total loans, loans secured by multifamily (5+ family) residential properties represented 3.6% and 3.5%, and loans secured by non-farm, non-residential properties represented 52.8% and 52.2%, respectively. Construction loans at December 31, 2012 and 2011 included $156.2 million and $136.7 million in loans to commercial builders of single family housing in the Northern Virginia market, representing 7.1% and 6.3% of total loans, respectively. The Bank has established formal policies relating to the credit and collateral requirements in loan originations including policies that establish limits on various loan types as a percentage of total loans and total capital. Loans to purchase real property are generally collateralized by the related property with limitations based on the property s appraised value. Credit approval is primarily a function of collateral and the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the individual borrower, guarantors and or the individual project. Management considers the concentration of credit risk to be minimal due to the diversification of borrowers over numerous businesses and industries. Note 18. Fund Restrictions and Reserve Balance The transfer of funds from the Bank to the Company in the form of loans, advances, and cash dividends are restricted by federal and state regulatory authorities. Regulations limit the payments of dividends by the Bank to the Company to the sum of the Bank s net income (as reportable in its Call Report) during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years, unless the dividend has been approved by the Federal Reserve Bank. The payment of dividends is further limited to an amount which would not reduce the capital ratios of the Bank from well capitalized. In addition, State and Federal agencies have the authority to prohibit a bank from paying a dividend if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice regardless of the amount of the dividend. At December 31, 2012, the Bank had $16.5 million available to dividend to the Company. In addition, under the Agreement between the Company and United discussed in more detail in Note 1, the Company is restricted from paying dividends to its shareholders until the effective time of the Merger. As members of the Federal Reserve System, the Company is required to maintain certain average reserve balances. For the final weekly reporting period in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the aggregate amounts of daily average required balances were approximately $7.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively. Note 19. Employee Benefits The Company has a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all full-time employees and provides that an employee becomes eligible to participate at the date he or she has reached the age of 21 and has completed three months of service, whichever occurs last. Under the plan, a participant may contribute up to 15% of his or her covered compensation for the year, subject to certain limitations. The Company may also make, but is not required to make, a discretionary contribution for each participant out of its current or accumulated net profits. The amount of contribution, if any, is determined on an annual basis by the Board of Directors. Contributions made by the Company totaled $474 thousand, $411 thousand and $331 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively 78 Note 20. Fair Value Measurements The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of FASB ASC, the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. The fair value guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value, which focuses on exit price in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. If there had been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of significant judgment. The fair value is a reasonable point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions. Fair Value Hierarchy In accordance with this guidance, the Company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities generally measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. Level 1 Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 assets and liabilities generally include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market. Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Valuation is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The valuation may be based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. A financial asset s or liability s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements: Investment securities available-for-sale : Investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices, when available (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. Third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that consider observable market data (Level 2). Currently, the Company considers its valuation of available-for-sale PreTSL securities as (Level 3). Based on financial market conditions, the Company feels that the fair values obtained from its third party vendor reflects forced liquidation and distressed sales of the PreTSL securities due to decreased volume and trading activity. Based upon management s review of the market conditions for PreTSL securities, it was determined that an income approach valuation technique (present value) that 79 maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimized the use of unobservable inputs is more representative of fair value than the market approach valuation technique used by the third party vendor. The present value technique discounts expected future cash flows of a security to arrive at a present value. The cash flow analysis assumes discount rates equal to the credit spread at the time of purchase for each security and then added the current 3-month LIBOR forward interest rate curve. The analysis includes other assumptions in determining present value, such as recoveries on deferrals and prepayments on securities. The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements for December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively (dollars in thousands): Carrying value at December 31, 2012 Description Balance as of December 31, 2012 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Investment securities available-for-sale U.S. Government Agency obligations $ 392,867 $ $ 392,867 $ Pooled trust preferred securities 357 357 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 100,200 100,200 Carrying value at December 31, 2011 Description Balance as of December 31, 2011 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Investment securities available-for-sale U.S. Government Agency obligations $ 523,987 $ $ 523,987 $ Pooled trust preferred securities 456 456 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 68,621 68,621 Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the financial statements: Loans held for sale : Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market value. These loans currently consist of one-to-four family residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Fair value is based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for similar loans using observable market data which is not materially different than cost due to the short duration between origination and sale (Level 2). As such, the Company records any fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. No nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded on loans held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Gains and losses on the sale of loans are recorded within income from mortgage banking on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Impaired Loans : The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, there are instances when a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan losses is established. Loans are designated as impaired when, in the judgment of management based on current information and events, it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. The measurement of loss associated with impaired loans can be based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans 80 effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral. Fair value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing the loans. Collateral may be in the form of real estate, financial assets, personal or business assets including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. The vast majority of the collateral is real estate. An impaired loan that is collateralized by cash is considered Level 1. The value of real estate collateral is based solely on observable cash flows, market price or a current appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser outside of the Company, or using observable market data (Level 2). However, if the collateral is a house or building in the process of construction, additional write-downs to fair value are required, or if an appraisal of the real estate property is over a year old, then the fair value is considered Level 3. The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business s financial statements if not considered significant, using observable market data. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports (Level 3). Impaired loans are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis through the allowance for loan losses. Any fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for loan losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Other Real Estate Owned / Foreclosed Assets: Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held-for-sale and are initially recorded at the lesser of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation are included in net expenses for other real estate owned. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the Company records the foreclosed asset as Level 2 valuation. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the Company records the foreclosed asset as Level 3 valuation. The following table summarizes the Company s assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively (dollars in thousands): Carrying value at December 31, 2012 Description Balance as of December 31, 2012 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Impaired loans $ 68,427 $ 1,486 $ 40,389 $ 26,552 Other real estate owned $ 12,302 $ $ 7,694 $ 4,608 Carrying value at December 31, 2011 Description Balance as of December 31, 2011 Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Assets: Impaired loans $ 83,207 $ 750 $ 6,727 $ 75,730 Other real estate owned $ 8,925 $ $ 4,257 $ 4,668 At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company did not have any liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 81 The following table displays quantitative information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements for December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Quantitative information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements for December 31, 2012 Assets Fair Value Valuation Technique(s) Unobservable input Range Impaired loans $ 11,745 Discounted appraised value Selling cost 5% - 25% Discount for lack of marketability and age of appraisal 0% - 50% $ 5,815 Discounted tax assessments Tax assessment 5% - 10% $ 8,992 Discounted cash flow Discount for expected levels of future cash flows 10% - 50% Other real estate owned $ 4,608 Discounted appraised value Selling cost 5% - 10% Discount for lack of marketability and age of appraisal 0% - 20% The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value: Cash and Short-Term Investments For those short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Securities For securities held for investment purposes, fair values are based upon quoted market prices, when available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. Third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that considers observable market data. The carrying value of restricted stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the issuers. Loans Held for Sale Fair value is based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for similar loans using observable market data which is not materially different than cost due to the short duration between origination and sale. Bank Owned Life Insurance Bank owned life insurance represents insurance policies on officers, directors and past employees of the Bank. The cash values of the policies are estimates using information provided by insurance carriers. These policies are carried at their cash surrender value, which approximates the fair value. Loan Receivables For certain homogeneous categories of loans, such as some residential mortgages, and other consumer loans, fair value is estimated using the quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. The fair value of other types of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. 82 Deposits and Borrowings The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. For all other deposits and borrowings, the fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method. The discount rate was equal to the rate currently offered on similar products. Accrued Interest The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value. Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments The fair value of commitments to extend credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair value of stand-by letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of loan commitments and stand-by letters of credit were deemed immaterial, and therefore, are not included in the table below. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows: Fair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2012, using (Dollars in thousands) Carrying Amount Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets Significant Other Observable Inputs Significant Unobservable Inputs Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets: Cash and short-term investments $ 50,531 $ 50,531 $ $ Investment securities 493,424 493,067 357 Restricted stock 10,147 10,147 Loans held-for-sale 15,195 15,195 Loan receivables 2,142,872 1,486 40,389 2,229,735 Bank-owned life insurance 44,393 44,393 Accrued interest receivable 8,563 8,563 Financial liabilities: Deposits $ 2,245,392 $ $ 2,260,622 $ Securities sold under agreement to repurchase 250,718 190,866 75,000 Other borrowed funds 7,000 7,000 Trust preferred capital notes 66,827 73,761 Accrued interest payable 1,885 1,885 83 The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments at December 31, 2011 is as follows: 2011 (Dollars in thousands) Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Financial assets: Cash and short-term investments $ 82,569 $ 82,569 Investment securities 624,956 628,390 Restricted stock 11,214 11,214 Loans held for sale 18,485 18,485 Loan receivables 2,120,291 2,123,328 Bank owned life insurance 14,017 14,017 Accrued interest receivable 10,007 10,007 2011 (Dollars in thousands) Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Financial liabilities: Deposits $ 2,292,158 $ 2,311,842 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase 263,273 281,145 Other borrowed funds 25,000 25,733 Trust preferred capital notes 66,570 103,680 Accrued interest payable 2,418 2,418 In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to market risk which includes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change). As a result, the fair values of the Company s financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize this risk. Note 21. Capital Requirements The Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s and Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Total capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 Leverage capital. Total capital and Tier 1 capital ratios are in reference to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and the Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio is in reference to average assets. Management believes, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, that the Company and Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 84 As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Bank was categorized as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2012, that management believes changed the Bank s category. The Company s and the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios are also presented in the table.

Note 22. Preferred Stock and Warrant On December 12, 2008, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement ( Agreement ) with the United States Department of the Treasury ( Treasury ) under the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) Capital Purchase Program ( CPP ), whereby the Company issued and sold to the Treasury 71,000 shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a par value of $1.00 and a liquidation amount of $1,000 per share, for a total price of $71.0 million. In addition, the Treasury received a warrant to purchase 2,696,203 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $3.95 per share. The preferred stock paid dividends quarterly, beginning February 2009, at a rate of 5% per year for the first five years, then would have increased to 9% thereafter. On December 11, 2012, the Company repurchased all of its preferred stock that was issued to the Treasury under the TARP CPP. Pursuant to the redemption, the Treasury received from the Company $71.3 million, consisting of $71.0 million in liquidation value of the preferred stock and approximately $256 thousand in accrued and unpaid dividends for the fourth quarter of 2012. The preferred stock had a carrying value of $68.9 million prior to repayment on December 11, 2012, net of unaccreted discount. The Company accelerated the accretion of the preferred stock discount in the fourth quarter of 2012, which reduced net income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2012 by approximately $2.1 million. The warrant has a ten year term, is immediately exercisable and remained outstanding at December 31, 2012. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Treasury will not exercise voting rights with respect to any shares of common stock it acquires upon exercise of the warrant; voting rights may be exercised by any other holder. As of December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2012, the allocated carrying value of the warrant, based on its fair value at the time of issuance, was $8.5 million. 85 Note 23.

Capital Issuance On March 31, 2011, the Company issued 426,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $5.87 per share in a registered direct placement with a Company director for total gross proceeds of approximately $2.5 million. In addition, the Company issued to the investor, warrants exercisable for shares of common stock, which, if fully exercised, would provide an additional $4.8 million in gross proceeds to the Company. The warrants each have an exercise price of $5.62 per share. The Series A warrants, exercisable for a total of 426,000 shares of common stock, were exercisable for a period of seven-months following the closing date. The Series B warrants, also exercisable for a total of 426,000 shares of common stock, are exercisable for a period of twelve months following the closing date. The 426,000 Series A warrants were exercised in full before they expired. In March 2012, the remaining 426,000 Series B warrants were exercised. On September 29, 2010, the Company issued 1,904,766 shares of its common stock at a price of $5.25 per share in a registered direct placement with several institutional investors for total gross proceeds of $10.0 million. In addition, the Company issued to the investors warrants exercisable for shares of common stock. The warrants each had an exercise price of $6.00 per share, which represents a 14.3% premium to the offering price of the shares of common stock sold in the registered direct placement. The Series A warrants were exercisable through April 30, 2011, and 130,851 were exercised as of that date. The 952,383 Series B warrants originally were to expire on September 29, 2011, but on September 27, 2011, the expiration date of 904,764 of the Series B Warrants was extended to January 27, 2012, with 47,619 warrants having been exercised prior to the warrant extension. Following the extension, in the fourth quarter of 2011, an additional 47,619 Series B warrants were exercised. As of December 31, 2011, 857,145 of the Series B warrants remained outstanding. During January 2012, the remaining 857,145 Series B warrants were exercised. BUSINESS General Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. (the Company ) was organized under Virginia law on November 5, 1999 to become the holding company for Virginia Commerce Bank (the Bank ). The Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of the Bank on December 22, 1999, upon the effectiveness of the Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange dated September 22, 1999 between the Company and the Bank. As a result of the Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange, each share of the Bank s common stock was automatically exchanged for and converted into one share of the Company s common stock. 88 The Bank was organized as a national banking association and commenced operations on May 16, 1988. On June 1, 1995, the Bank converted from a national banking association to a Virginia chartered bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Company s and the Bank s executive offices and main branch are located at 5350 Lee Highway, Arlington, Virginia. The Bank currently has twenty-seven additional full service branch offices throughout Northern Virginia, an investment services office in Vienna, Virginia, and a residential mortgage lending office in Chantilly, Virginia. The Company engages in a general commercial banking business through the Bank, its sole direct operating subsidiary. The Bank s customer base includes small-to-medium-sized businesses, including firms that have contracts with the U.S. government, associations, retailers and industrial businesses, professionals and business executives and consumers. The economic base of the Bank s service area includes Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Loudoun, Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford Counties and the City of Alexandria in Northern Virginia, and the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area generally. Northern Virginia has experienced significant population and economic growth during the past decade. The Bank participated in this growth through its commercial and retail banking activities. The Bank s primary service area consists of the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C., including Arlington Fairfax, Fauquier, Loudoun, Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford Counties and the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Fredericksburg, Manassas and Manassas Park. Its service area also covers, to a lesser extent, Washington, D.C. and the nearby Maryland counties of Montgomery and Prince Georges. This area s banking business is dominated by a small number of large commercial banks with extensive branch networks. Most are branches of national, state-wide or regional banks. The Bank s primary service area is also served by a large number of other financial institutions, including savings banks, credit unions and non-bank financial institutions such as securities brokerage firms, insurance companies and mutual funds. The Bank s primary service area is oriented toward independently owned small-to-medium-sized businesses, light industry and firms specializing in government contracting. The banking business in Virginia generally, and in the Bank s primary service area specifically, is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits, and is dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area. Among the advantages such major banks have over the Bank are their ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment assets to regions of highest yield and demand. Such banks offer certain services such as international banking, which are not offered directly by the Bank (but are offered indirectly through correspondent institutions) and, by virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks have substantially higher lending limits than the Bank. The Bank competes for deposits and lendable funds with other commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions and other governmental and corporate entities which raise operating capital through the issuance of debt and equity securities. The Bank also competes for available investment dollars with non-bank financial institutions, such as brokerage firms, insurance companies and mutual funds. With respect to loans, the Bank competes with other commercial banks, savings banks, consumer finance companies, mortgage companies, credit unions and other lending institutions. Additionally, as a result of enactment of federal and Virginia interstate banking legislation, additional competitors which are not currently operating in Virginia may enter the Bank s markets and compete directly with the Bank. The majority of the Bank s deposits are attracted from individuals and businesses in the metropolitan Washington D.C. area, and as such, no material portion of the Bank s deposits have been obtained from any single person, single entity, or area outside the metropolitan Washington D.C. area. The loss of any one or more of the Bank s depositors would not have a materially adverse effect on the business of the Bank. Although the Bank s loans are concentrated in its Northern Virginia market area, and a significant portion are secured by real property in that market, the Bank s loans are not concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on concentrations of credit risk. The Bank provides businesses with a full range of deposit accounts, merchant bankcard services, electronic funds transfer services, lock-box services, remote deposit capture, on-line banking, lines of credit for working capital, term loans and commercial real estate loans, and provides consumers with a wide array of deposit products, home equity and revolving lines of credit, installment loans and internet banking services. The Bank also offers investment services and provides safe deposit boxes as well as other customary banking services. The Bank is not authorized to offer trust services nor does it offer international services but makes these services available to its customers through financial institutions with which the Bank has correspondent banking relationships. 89 The Bank also offers a wide variety of residential mortgage loans through its mortgage lending unit. Prior to mid-2007, substantially all of the Bank s mortgage loans were originated on a pre-sold basis, servicing released, to numerous secondary market purchasers. Since mid-2007, and due to changes and disruptions in the secondary market for mortgage loans, the Company has been holding a greater portion of mortgage loans in portfolio. See Lending Activities Mortgage Lending below. Offered types include conventional single family first trusts, FHA and VA mortgages for both purchase and refinance purposes. The Bank does not depend upon seasonal business. The Bank relies substantially on local promotional activity, personal contact by its officers, directors, employees and stockholders, personalized service and its reputation in the communities served to compete effectively. The Bank has four wholly owned subsidiaries, Northeast Land and Investment Company, Tombstone Land Company and Canova Land and Investment Company, all Virginia corporations, organized to hold and market foreclosed real estate, and Virginia Commerce Insurance Agency, L.L.C., which has been inactive since its inception. On December 31, 2012, the Company had 330 full-time equivalent employees, including seven executive officers. None of the Company s employees presently is represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. Management of the Company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory. The Company does not have any employees that are not also employees of the Bank. Banking is dependent upon interest rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest rate paid by the Bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest rate earned by the Bank on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets comprises the major source of the Bank s earnings, while investment services commissions and fees and net gains on mortgage loans originated for sale have contributed to the Bank s non-interest earnings. Thus, the earnings and growth of the Bank are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also of the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board implements national monetary policy, such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession, by its open-market activities in United States government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements and through adjustments to the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board may also take other actions from time to time, including purchases of mortgage-backed securities and other securities. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates. The nature and timing of any future changes in such policies and their impact on the Bank cannot be predicted. In addition, adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan loss charge-offs, thus adversely affecting the Bank s net income. From time to time, new legislation or regulations are adopted which increase the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or otherwise affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. For a summary of the regulations that apply to the Company s and the Bank s operations, including a summary of recent regulatory changes, please see Regulation, Supervision, and Governmental Policy beginning on page 93. Banks or bank holding companies which are undercapitalized and either have not timely approved a capital plan or have failed to implement the plan become subject to extraordinary powers pursuant to which the bank regulatory agencies may close the bank, restrict its growth, force its sale, restrict interest rates paid on deposits, and dismiss directors or senior executive officers. Each agency has prescribed standards relating to internal controls and systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and other operational and managerial standards. The agencies have also adopted standards relating to asset quality, earnings, valuation and compensation. Banks or bank holding companies which do not meet such standards may be subject to restrictions and consequences comparable to those which apply to undercapitalized banks and bank holding companies. Bank regulatory authority to appoint a conservator or receiver for a bank is broad, including grounds such as substantial dissipation of assets or earnings due to violations of law or regulation or due to any unsafe or unsound practices, an unsafe or unsound condition, and certain violations of law or regulation likely to weaken the institution s condition. Regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board prohibit state member banks such as the Bank from paying any dividend on common stock out of capital. Dividends can be paid only to the extent of net profits then on hand, less losses and bad debts. Without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, a state member bank cannot pay dividends in any calendar year in excess of the retained net profits for the prior two years and the profits of the current year, less any required transfers to surplus. 90 Lending Activities The Bank offers a wide array of lending services to its customers, including commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, lines of credit, equipment financing, construction loans, letters of credit, residential mortgages, personal loans, auto loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. Loan terms, including interest rates, loan-to-value ratios, and maturities, are tailored as much as possible to meet the needs of the borrower within prudent lending guidelines in terms of interest rate risk and credit risk. When considering loan requests, the primary factors taken into consideration are the purpose, the cash flow and financial condition of the borrower, primary and secondary repayment sources, the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, and the character and integrity of the borrower. These factors are evaluated in a number of ways including an analysis of financial statements, credit history, trade references and visits to the borrower s place of business. The Bank has adopted a comprehensive loan policy manual to provide its loan officers with underwriting, term, collateral, loan-to-value and pricing guidelines. The Bank s goal is to build and maintain a commercial loan portfolio consisting of term loans, lines of credit, commercial real estate and construction loans provided primarily to locally-based borrowers. Additionally, installment loans and personal lines of credit, as well as residential mortgages, are made available to consumer customers. Commercial loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of risk of default or loss than other types of loans, such as residential real estate loans, because repayment may be affected by general economic conditions, interest rates, the quality of management of the business, and other factors which may cause a borrower to be unable to repay its obligations. General economic conditions can directly or indirectly affect the quality of a small and mid-sized business loan portfolio. The Bank manages the loan portfolio to avoid high concentrations of similar industry loan types and/or property types in relation to total qualifying capital. The Bank aims for commercial construction loans to make up 50-75% of total qualifying capital, residential builder construction loans 50-75%, non-farm non-residential real estate loans 250-350%, and residential mortgages and home equity loans 100-200%, commercial loans 125-200% and consumer installment and personal loans 25-50%. There can however, be no assurance that the Bank will be able to achieve or maintain this distribution of loans. At December 31, 2012, the loan portfolio s actual composition compared to total qualifying capital consisted of approximately 34% commercial construction loans, 52% residential builder construction loans, 354% non-farm non-residential real estate loans, 147% residential mortgages and home equity loans, 80% commercial loans and 3% consumer installment and personal loans. The lending activities in which we engage carry the risk that borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations. As such, interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board and general economic conditions, nationally and in our primary market area will have a significant impact on our results of operations. To the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their obligations in a timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses to the Bank. To the extent that loans are secured by real estate, adverse conditions in the real estate market may reduce the ability of the borrower to generate the necessary cash flow for repayment of the loan and reduce our ability to collect the full amount of the loan upon a default. These same external factors could also negatively impact collateral values. To the extent that the Bank makes fixed rate loans, general increases in interest rates will tend to reduce our spread as the interest rates we must pay for deposits increase. Interest rates may also adversely affect the value of property pledged as security for loans. We constantly strive to mitigate risks in the event of unforeseen threats to the loan portfolio as a result of an economic downturn or other negative influences. Plans for mitigating inherent risks in managing loan assets include carefully enforcing loan policies and procedures, evaluating each borrower s industry and business plan during the underwriting process, identifying and monitoring primary and alternative sources for repayment, obtaining collateral that is margined to minimize loss in the event of liquidation, ongoing tests of borrower credit worthiness and cash flow, ongoing collateral evaluations and site inspections and monitoring of economic and market trends. Loan business is generated primarily through referrals and direct-calling efforts. Referrals of loan business come from directors, stockholders, current customers and professionals such as lawyers, accountants and financial intermediaries. At December 31, 2012, the Banks statutory lending limit to any single borrower was $48.9 million subject to certain exceptions provided under applicable law. As of December 31, 2012, the Bank was in compliance with its statutory legal lending limit. Commercial Loans: Commercial loans are written for any legitimate business purpose including the financing of plant and equipment, interim working capital pending collection of accounts receivable, permanent working capital 91 for growth and the acquisition and construction of real estate projects. There is a focus in the Bank s loan portfolio on commercial real estate investment which represents a predominant activity in the Bank s market area. The Bank s commercial loan portfolio reflects a diverse group of borrowers with no significant concentration in any borrower, or group of borrowers. Commercial construction loans, residential construction loans to builders and land acquisition and development loans are made to builders with established track records of quality construction. Land loans are discouraged unless underwritten in conjunction with a related construction loan or out-sale contract. Typical advance rates are not greater than 65% of the lesser of cost or appraisal for raw land, 75% of the value of finished lots for land acquisition, and 80% of land cost and 100% of construction costs for construction loans. In all cases, a minimum 10% cash equity contribution of total project costs is required which may be supplemented by subordinate seller financing. Financing terms generally do not exceed 24 months. Construction loans are subject to progress inspections and controlled advances. Speculative construction loans are maintained to a minimum with a majority of loans requiring pre-sale contracts or specified lease-up thresholds prior to construction commencement. Personal guarantees by principals of borrowing entities is a standard requirement and loans are typically priced to float at a factor at or above the prime lending rate or LIBOR. Commercial real estate loans generally relate to borrower occupied properties with a principal reliance on the borrowing businesses ability to repay or investor transactions focused on tenant quality, occupancy and expense controls, as well as prudent guidelines for assessing real estate values. Risks inherent in managing a commercial real estate portfolio relate to either sudden or gradual drops in property values as a result of a general or local economic downturn. A decline in real estate values can cause loan to value margins to increase and diminish the Bank s equity cushion on both an individual and portfolio basis. The Bank attempts to mitigate commercial real estate lending risks by carefully underwriting each loan of this type to address the perceived risks in the individual transaction. Generally, the Bank requires a loan-to-value ratio of 80% of the lesser of cost or appraisal for owner occupied transactions and 75% for investor transactions. A borrower s ability to repay is carefully analyzed and policy calls for a minimum ongoing cash flow to debt service requirement of 1.15 to 1 (or higher on an amortizing basis depending upon property type), although most loans exceed this minimum. An approved list of commercial real estate appraisers selected on the basis of a reputation for quality and accuracy has been established. Each appraisal is scrutinized by a bank officer or consultant independent of the loan officer in an effort to insure compliance with established appraisal guidelines and conformity with current comparable market values. The Bank generally requires personal guarantees on all loans to closely-held entities as a matter of policy and non-recourse loans are discouraged except in situations of extraordinary equity and debt service coverage. Borrowers are required to provide, at a minimum, annual corporate, partnership and personal financial statements to comply with Bank policy. Interest rate risk to the Bank is mitigated by using either floating interest rates or by fixing rates for an intermediate period of time, generally five years or less. While loan amortizations may be approved for up to 360 months, loans generally amortize over 300 months or less and have a call provision (maturity date) of 10 years or less. Commercial term loans are used to provide funds for equipment and general corporate needs. This loan category is designed to support borrowers who have a proven ability to service debt over a term generally not to exceed 84 months. The Bank typically requires a first lien position on the collateral financed and other business assets and guarantees from owners having at least a 20% interest in the business. Interest rates on commercial term loans generally float or are fixed for a term not to exceed seven years. Management carefully monitors industry and collateral concentrations to avoid loan exposures to a large group of similar industries and/or similar collateral. Commercial loans are evaluated for historical and projected cash flow, balance sheet strength and primary and secondary repayment sources. Commercial term loan documents include certain financial and performance covenants and require borrowers to forward regular financial information on both the business and on personal guarantors at least annually. In certain cases, this information is required more frequently, depending on the degree to which lenders desire information to monitor a borrower s financial condition and compliance with loan covenants. Key person life insurance is required as appropriate and as necessary to mitigate the risk associated with the loss of a primary owner or manager. Commercial lines of credit are used to finance a business borrower s short-term or seasonal credit needs and advances are often based on a percentage of eligible receivables and, in certain limited circumstances inventory. In addition to the risks inherent in term loan facilities, line of credit borrowers typically require additional monitoring to protect the lender against diminishing collateral values. Commercial lines of credit are generally revolving in nature and payable on demand. The Bank generally requires at least an annual rest period (for seasonal borrowers) and regular financial information (monthly or quarterly financial statements, monthly accounts receivable agings, borrowing base certificates, etc.) for borrowers with rapid growth and perpetual working capital financing needs. Advances against 92 collateral are generally margined, limiting advances on eligible receivables to 75-80% of current accounts for commercial receivables and 85-90% for municipal or United States government receivables. Lines of credit and term loans to the same borrowers are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized. Industry and collateral concentration disciplines are the same as those used in managing the commercial term loan portfolio. Interest rate charges on this group of loans generally float at a factor at or above the prime lending rate or LIBOR. Generally, personal guarantees are also required on these loans. Consumer Loans. Loans are considered for any worthwhile personal purpose on a case-by-case basis, such as financing of tuition, household expenditures, home and automobile financing. Consumer credit facilities are underwritten to focus on the borrower s credit record, length and stability of employment, income to service debt and quality of collateral. Residential real estate loans held in portfolio are limited to advances of 90% of loan to appraised value without private mortgage insurance. Maximum debt service to income ratio established by loan policy is 45% and maximum unsecured revolving debt will not exceed 10% of net worth. Installment loan terms range out to 72 months and are priced at fixed interest rates. Home equity loans amortize over 5-15 years and are fixed rate while home equity lines are revolving with 10-year maturities and have floating rates tied to the prime rate. Mortgage Lending. The Company originates residential mortgage loans, on a pre-sold basis, for sale to secondary market purchasers, on a servicing released basis. This produces benefits primarily in the form of gains on the sale of the loans at a premium. Activity in the residential mortgage loan market is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. The loans are sold on a limited recourse basis. Most contracts with investors contain recourse periods that may vary from 90 days up to one year except in the case of borrower fraud or material misstatement of fact which may extend the recourse period longer. In general, the Company may be required to repurchase a previously sold mortgage loan or indemnify the investor if there is major non-compliance with defined loan origination or documentation standards, including fraud, negligence or material misstatement in the loan documents. Repurchase may also be required if necessary governmental loan guarantees are canceled or never issued, or if an investor is forced to buy back a loan after it has been re-sold as part of a loan pool. In addition, the Company may have an obligation to repurchase a loan if the mortgagor has defaulted early in the loan term. The potential default period is approximately twelve months after sale of the loan to the investor. Mortgages subject to recourse are collateralized by single-family residential properties, have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or less, or have private mortgage insurance or are insured or guaranteed by an agency of the United States government. In addition, the Company originates residential mortgage loans to hold in portfolio for investment. These residential mortgage loans have characteristics that are similar to residential mortgage loans that are originated and sold on a limited recourse basis. On a limited basis, the Company holds some first trust residential mortgages in portfolio which have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or less or are subject to private mortgage insurance. Maximum debt service to income ratio is 45%. Adjustable rate mortgage products amortize over a 30 year period; fixed rate products amortize over 15-30 years. Credit and Loan Administration. As part of its internal credit and loan administration process, the Bank s Directors Loan Committee, comprised of directors, reviews all loans 30-days delinquent, loans on the watch list, loans rated special mention, substandard, or doubtful and other loans of concern at least quarterly. The Committee also reviews new loan production, credit concentrations, loan loss reserves, declined loans, documentation exceptions, loan policy exceptions, new products and pricing. The Committee commissions periodic documentation and internal control reviews by outside vendors to complement internal audit and credit administration oversight. Regulation, Supervision, and Governmental Policy The Company. The Company is a bank holding company registered under Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, (the BHCA ) and is subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such other additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHCA. The Federal Reserve Board may also make examinations of the Company and each of its subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or ownership constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of the bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 93 Regulatory Reform. The financial crisis of 2008, including the downturn of global economic, financial and money markets and the treat of collapse of numerous financial institutions, and other recent events have led to the adoption of numerous new laws and regulations that apply to, and focus on, financial institutions. As a result, the Company is experiencing a period of rapidly changing regulations. These regulatory changes could have a significant impact on how the Company conducts its business. Many of these regulatory changes including those contained within the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) remain subject to ongoing rulemaking and other regulatory processes, and the Company cannot yet predict the specific implications of these and other proposed regulatory reforms. BHCA Activities and other Limitations. The BHCA requires approval of the Federal Reserve Board for, among other things, the acquisition by a proposed bank holding company of control of more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares, or substantially all the assets, of any bank or the merger or consolidation by a bank holding company with another bank holding company. The BHCA also generally permits the acquisition by a bank holding company of control or substantially all the assets of any bank located in a state other than the home state of the bank holding company, except where the bank has not been in existence for the minimum period of time required by state law, but if the bank is at least 5 years old, the Federal Reserve Board may approve the acquisition. Under current law, with certain limited exceptions, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing service for its authorized subsidiaries. A bank holding company may, however, engage in or acquire an interest in, a company that engages in activities which the Federal Reserve Board has determined by order or regulation to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. In making such a determination, the Federal Reserve Board is required to consider whether the performance of such activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, which outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve Board is also empowered to differentiate between activities commenced de novo and activities commenced by the acquisition, in whole or in part, of a going concern. Some of the activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking include making or servicing loans, performing certain data processing services, acting as a fiduciary or investment or financial advisor, and making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare. Effective on March 11, 2000, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999 (the GLB Act ) allows a bank holding company or other company to certify status as a financial holding company, which allows such company to engage in activities that are financial in nature, that are incidental to such activities, or are complementary to such activities. The GLB Act enumerates certain activities that are deemed financial in nature, such as underwriting insurance or acting as an insurance principal, agent or broker, underwriting, dealing in or making markets in securities, and engaging in merchant banking under certain restrictions. It also authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to determine by regulation what other activities are financial in nature, or incidental or complementary thereto. Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on any extensions of credit to the bank company or any of its subsidiaries, or investments in the stock or other securities thereof, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Further, a holding company and any subsidiary bank are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit. A subsidiary bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that: (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to such bank other than a loan, discount, deposit or trust service; (ii) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or service from or to company or any other subsidiary of the company; or (iii) the customer not obtain some other credit, property or service from competitors, except for reasonable requirements to assure the soundness of credit extended. Commitments to Subsidiary Banks. Under Federal Reserve policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances when it might not do so absent such policy. Limitations of Acquisitions of Common Stock. The federal Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been given 60 days prior written notice of such proposed acquisition and within that time period the Federal Reserve Board has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition or extending for up to another 30 days the period during which such a disapproval may be issued. 94 An acquisition may be made prior to expiration of the disapproval period if the Federal Reserve issues written notice of its intent not to disapprove the action. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or which would represent the single largest interest in the voting stock would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute the acquisition of control. In addition, with limited exceptions, any company would be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding common stock of, or such lesser number of shares as constitute control over, the Company. Such approval would be contingent upon, among other things, the acquirer registering as a bank holding company, divesting all impermissible holdings and ceasing any activities not permissible for a bank holding company. The Dodd-Frank Act amended provisions of the BHCA and (corresponding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) to require that a bank holding company be well capitalized and well managed before the Federal Reserve will approve an interstate bank acquisition or merger. The Federal Reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of an institution s capital. These guidelines are substantially similar to those which are applicable to the Bank, discussed below. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company must file annual, quarterly and other periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). The Company must comply with other rules and regulations of the SEC, including the corporate responsibility and accounting reform legislation known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the SOX Act ). The Bank. The Bank, as a Virginia chartered commercial bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System (a state member bank ) and whose accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) of the FDIC up to the maximum legal limits of the FDIC, is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Financial Institutions, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. The regulations of these various agencies govern most aspects of the Bank s business, including required reserves against deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowing, dividends and location and number of branch offices. The laws and regulations governing the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the DIF, and not for the purpose of protecting stockholders. Competition among commercial banks, savings banks, and credit unions has increased following enactment of legislation which greatly expanded the ability of banks and bank holding companies to engage in interstate banking or acquisition activities. As a result of federal and state legislation, banks in the Washington D.C./Maryland/Virginia area can, subject to limited restrictions, acquire or merge with a bank in another of the jurisdictions, and can branch de novo in any of the jurisdictions. The GLB Act allows a wider array of companies to own banks, which could result in companies with resources substantially in excess of the Company s entering into competition with the Company and the Bank. Branching. The Dodd-Frank Act substantially amended the legal framework that had previously governed interstate branching activities. Formerly, under the Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, a bank s ability to branch into a particular state was largely dependent upon whether the state opted in to de novo interstate branching. Many states did not opt-in, which resulted in branching restrictions in those states. The Dodd- Frank Act removed the opt-in concept and permits banks to engage in de novo branching outside of their home states, provided that the laws of the target state permit banks chartered in that state to branch within that state. Accordingly, de novo interstate branching by the Bank is subject to these new standards. Capital Adequacy Guidelines. The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have adopted risk based capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which they assess the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising banks and bank holding companies and in analyzing bank regulatory applications. Risk-based capital requirements determine the adequacy of capital based on the risk inherent in various classes of assets and off-balance sheet items. State member banks are expected to meet a minimum ratio of total qualifying capital (the sum of core capital (Tier 1) and supplementary capital (Tier 2)) to risk weighted assets of 8%. At least half of this amount (4%) should be in the form of core capital. Tier 1 capital generally consists of the sum of common stockholders equity and perpetual preferred stock (subject in the case of the latter to limitations on the kind and amount of such stock which may be included as Tier 1 capital), less goodwill, without adjustment for changes in the market value of securities classified as available-for-sale 95 in accordance with ASC 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities. For the Company, the cumulative perpetual stock issued to the Treasury Department pursuant to the Capital Purchase Program established under the EESA is eligible for treatment as Tier 1 capital without limitation. Tier 2 Capital consists of the following: hybrid capital instruments; perpetual preferred stock which is not otherwise eligible to be included as Tier 1 Capital; term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock; and, subject to limitations, general allowances for loan losses. As long as the Company has total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion, the Company may include in Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital the Company s trust preferred securities that were issued before May 19, 2010. Assets are adjusted under the risk-based guidelines to take into account different risk characteristics, with the categories ranging from 0% (requiring no risk-based capital) for assets such as cash and certain U.S. Government and Agency securities, to 100% for the bulk of assets which are typically held by a bank holding company, including commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans and consumer loans. Residential first mortgage loans on one-to-four family residential real estate and certain seasoned multi-family residential real estate loans, which are not 90 days or more past-due or non-performing and which have been made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards are assigned a 50% level in the risk-weighting system, as are certain privately-issued mortgage-backed securities representing indirect ownership of such loans. Off-balance sheet items also are adjusted to take into account certain risk characteristics. In addition to the risk-based capital requirements, the Federal Reserve Board has established a minimum 3.0% Leverage Capital Ratio (Tier 1 capital to total adjusted assets) requirement for the most highly-rated banks, with an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points for all other banks, which effectively increases the minimum Leverage Capital Ratio for such other banks to 4.0% 5.0% or more. The highest-rated banks are those that are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and have well diversified risk, including no undue interest rate risk exposure, excellent asset quality, high liquidity, good earnings and, in general, those which are considered a strong banking organization. A bank having less than the minimum Leverage Capital Ratio requirement shall, within 60 days of the date as of which it fails to comply with such requirement, submit a reasonable plan describing the means and timing by which the bank shall achieve its minimum Leverage Capital Ratio requirement. A bank which fails to file such plan is deemed to be operating in an unsafe and unsound manner, and could subject a bank to a cease-and-desist order. Any insured depository institution with a Leverage Capital Ratio that is less than 2.0% is deemed to be operating in an unsafe or unsound condition pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDIA ) and is subject to potential termination of deposit insurance. However, such an institution will not be subject to an enforcement proceeding solely on account of its capital ratios, if it has entered into and is in compliance with a written agreement to increase its Leverage Capital Ratio and to take such other action as may be necessary for the institution to be operated in a safe and sound manner. The capital regulations also provide, among other things, for the issuance of a capital directive, which is a final order issued to a bank that fails to maintain minimum capital or to restore its capital to the minimum capital requirement within a specified time period. Such directive is enforceable in the same manner as a final cease-and-desist order. At December 31, 2012, the Bank s Tier 1 risk based capital ratio was 12.82%, its Total risk based capital ratio was 14.08% and its Leverage Capital ratio was 10.03%. At December 31, 2012, the Company s Tier 1 Capital was 13.25%, its Total Capital was 14.51% and its Leverage Capital ratio was 10.29%. Basel III Capital Framework . In June 2012, the federal bank regulatory agencies proposed (i) rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and (ii) rules for calculating risk-weighted assets. The federal bank regulatory agencies have delayed the implementation of Basel III and the new risk-weighted assets calculations to consider comments received on the proposed rules. The timing for the agencies publication of revised proposed rules regarding, or final rules to implement, Basel III and the new risk-weighted assets calculations is uncertain. The Basel III final capital framework, among other things, (i) introduces as a new capital measure Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), (ii) specifies that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations. When fully phased in, Basel III would require banks to maintain (i) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of Total (that is, Tier 1 plus 96 Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). Basel III also provides for a countercyclical capital buffer, generally designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk. This buffer would be a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented (potentially resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%). The Basel III final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 are currently expected to be phased-in over a five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer is expected to begin at 0.625% and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount each year, until it reaches 2.5%). In connection with proposing rules to adopt the Basel III capital framework, the federal banking regulators also proposed revisions to the general rules for calculating a banking organization s total risk-weighted assets (the denominator for risk-based capital ratios) (such revisions, the Standardized Approach ). If adopted as proposed, the Standardized Approach would modify the risk-weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, importantly including by applying higher risk-weightings to certain higher risk mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans that are frequently held in a community bank s loan portfolio. The regulations ultimately applicable to the Company may be substantially different from the Basel III or Standardized Approach proposed rules that were issued in June 2012. Requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company s net income and return on equity. Prompt Corrective Action. Under Section 38 of the FDIA, each federal banking agency is required to implement a system of prompt corrective action for institutions which it regulates. The federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective action established by Section 38 of the FDIA. Under the regulations, a bank shall be deemed to be: (i) well capitalized if it has a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or more, a Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio of 6.0% or more, a Leverage Capital Ratio of 5.0% or more and is not subject to any written capital order or directive; (ii) adequately capitalized if it has a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio of 4.0% or more and a Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of 4.0% or more (3.0% under certain circumstances) and does not meet the definition of well capitalized; (iii) undercapitalized if it has a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 Risk based Capital Ratio that is less than 4.0% or a Leverage Capital Ratio that is less than 4.0% (3.0% under certain circumstances); (iv) significantly undercapitalized if it has a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio that is less than 3.0% or a Leverage Capital Ratio that is less than 3.0%; and (v) critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. An institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements with an appropriate federal banking agency within 45 days of the date the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. A federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice of approval or disapproval within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan, subject to extensions by the applicable agency. An institution which is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution. Such guaranty shall be limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the institution s total assets at the time the institution was notified or deemed to have notice that it was undercapitalized or (ii) the amount necessary at such time to restore the relevant capital measures of the institution to the levels required for the institution to be classified as adequately capitalized. Such a guaranty shall expire after the federal banking agency notifies the institution that it has remained adequately capitalized for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. An institution which fails to submit a written capital restoration plan within the requisite period, including any required performance guaranty, or fails in any material respect to implement a capital restoration plan, shall be subject to the restrictions in Section 38 of the FDIA which are applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions. At December 31, 2012, the Company and Bank were each considered to be a well capitalized institution for purposes of Section 38 of the FDIA. 97 A critically undercapitalized institution is to be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days unless the FDIC formally determines that forbearance from such action would better protect the DIF. Unless the FDIC or other appropriate federal banking regulatory agency makes specific further findings and certifies that the institution is viable and is not expected to fail, an institution that remains critically undercapitalized on average during the fourth calendar quarter after the date it becomes critically undercapitalized must be placed in receivership. The general rule is that the FDIC will be appointed as receiver within 90 days after a bank becomes critically undercapitalized unless extremely good cause is shown and an extension is agreed to by the federal regulators. In general, good cause is defined as capital which has been raised and is imminently available for infusion into the bank except for certain technical requirements which may delay the infusion for a period of time beyond the 90 day time period. Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, an institution shall become subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA, which (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the DIF, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: requiring the institution to raise additional capital; restricting transactions with affiliates; requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; and any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions. Additionally, under Section 11(c)(5) of the FDIA, a conservator or receiver may be appointed for an institution where: (i) an institution s obligations exceed its assets; (ii) there is substantial dissipation of the institution s assets or earnings as a result of any violation of law or any unsafe or unsound practice; (iii) the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition; (iv) there is a willful violation of a cease-and-desist order; (v) the institution is unable to pay its obligations in the ordinary course of business; (vi) losses or threatened losses deplete all or substantially all of an institution s capital, and there is no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized without assistance; (vii) there is any violation of law or unsafe or unsound practice or condition that is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of assets or earnings, weaken the institution s condition, or otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of depositors or the insurance fund; (viii) an institution ceases to be insured; (ix) the institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect that it will become adequately capitalized, fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so, or fails to submit or materially implement a capital restoration plan; or (x) the institution is critically undercapitalized or otherwise has substantially insufficient capital. Regulatory Enforcement Authority . Federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. As a result of the volatility and instability in the financial system during 2008 and of the subsequent economic conditions through 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Congress, the bank regulatory authorities and other government agencies have called for proposed or adopted additional regulation and restrictions on the activities, practices and operations of banks and their holding companies. In addition to proposals that relate to institutions, such as the Company, that have accepted investments from, or sold troubled assets to, the Department of the Treasury or other government instrumentalities, or otherwise participate in government programs intended to promote financial stabilization, the Congress and the federal banking agencies have broad authority to require all banks and holding companies to adhere to more rigorous or costly operating procedures, corporate governance procedures, or to engage in activities or practices which they would not otherwise elect. As summarized below, the Dodd-Frank Act represents a sweeping overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, mandates significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape that will likely impose additional regulatory requirements on the Company and the Bank. Any such additional requirement could adversely affect the Company s and Bank s business and results of operations. 98 The Dodd-Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that will affect all bank holding companies and banks, including the Company and the Bank. Such provisions affecting the business of the Company and the Bank include the following: Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital. The Dodd-Frank Act also made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and increased the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000. Payment of Interest on Demand Deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts. Creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act centralized significant aspects of consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB ), which is discussed in more detail below. Debit Card Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) to, among other things, require that debit card interchange fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. In June 2011, the Federal Reserve Board adopted regulations setting the maximum permissible interchange fee as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, with an additional adjustment of up to one cent per transaction if the issuer implements additional fraud-prevention standards. Although issuers that have assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from the Federal Reserve Board s regulations that set maximum interchange fees, these regulations are expected to significantly affect the interchange fees that financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets are able to collect. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act implements other far-reaching changes to the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that: Restrict the preemption of state law by federal law and disallow subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks from availing themselves of such preemption. Require bank holding companies and banks to be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state. Impose comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, subject to significant rulemaking processes, which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself. Require depository institutions with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct regular stress tests and require large, publicly traded bank holding companies to create a risk committee responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management. Prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (the Volker Rule ). Implement corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions. Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company and the Bank or their customers or the financial industry more generally. Some of the rules that have been proposed and, in some cases, adopted to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act s mandates are discussed further below. Insurance of Accounts, Assessments and Regulation by the FDIC . The Bank s deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the standard maximum insurance amount for each deposit ownership category. As of January 1, 2013, the basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes. Deposit Insurance Assessments. The DIF is funded by assessments on banks and other depository institutions. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in February 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule that changed the assessment base for 99 DIF assessments from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital). In addition, as also required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a new large-bank pricing assessment scheme, and set a current target designated reserve ratio (described in more detail below) of 2 percent for the DIF, and established a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15 percent and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower assessment rate schedule, when the reserve ratio reaches 2 percent and 2.5 percent. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the FDIC increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the DIF, or the designated reserve ratio. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act (i) raised the minimum designated reserve ratio to 1.35 percent and removed the upper limit on the designated reserve ratio, (ii) requires that the designated reserve ratio reach 1.35 percent by September 2020, and (iii) requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion of raising the designated reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent. The FDIA requires that the FDIC consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis. On October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The restoration plan requires the FDIC to update its loss and income projections for the DIF at least semiannually, and if needed the FDIC may increase or decrease assessment rates following a notice-and-comment rulemaking. Limits on Dividends. The Company is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from the Bank. A significant portion of the revenues of the Company result from dividends paid to it by the Bank. Both the Company and the Bank are subject to laws and regulations that limit the payment of dividends, including limits on the sources of dividends and requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums. Banking regulators have indicated that Virginia banking organizations should generally pay dividends only (1) from net undivided profits of the bank, after providing for all expenses, losses, interest and taxes accrued or due by the bank, and (2) if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the FDIA prohibits insured depository institutions such as the Bank from making capital distributions, including paying dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become undercapitalized as defined in the statute. Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a federal regulatory agency that is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10 billion of assets and, to a lesser extent, smaller institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to supervise and regulate providers of consumer financial products and services, and establishes the CFPB s power to act against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, and gives the CFPB rulemaking authority in connection with numerous federal consumer financial protection laws (for example, but not limited to, the Truth-in-Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and many other federal laws related to the Bank s residential mortgage banking operations). As a smaller institution (i.e., with assets of $10 billion or less), most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be applied to the Company by the Federal Reserve and to the Bank by the FDIC and the Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Financial Institutions. However, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by a small institution s prudential regulators and may require smaller institutions to comply with certain CFPB reporting requirements. In addition, regulatory positions taken by the CFPB and administrative and legal precedents established by CFPB enforcement activities, including in connection with supervision of larger bank holding companies, could influence how the Federal Reserve and FDIC apply consumer protection laws and regulations to financial institutions that are not directly supervised by the CFPB. The precise effect of the CFPB s consumer protection activities on the Company cannot be forecast. Confidentiality and Required Disclosures of Customer Information. The Company is subject to various laws and regulations that address the privacy of nonpublic personal financial information of customers. Federal banking laws and regulations generally protect against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumer nonpublic person information. A financial institution must provide to its customers, at the beginning of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers nonpublic personal financial information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer s personal financial information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that the information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. The Company is also subject to various laws and regulations that attempt to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions to, among other things, create a system of controls designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and imposes recordkeeping and reporting 100 requirements. The USA Patriot Act facilitates information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering, and requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (the FBI ) sends banking regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities, and requests banks to search their records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists. If the Bank finds any relationships or transactions, it must fine a suspicious activity report with the Treasury and contact the FBI. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (the OFAC ), which is a division of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with enemies of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. If the Bank finds a name of an enemy of the United States on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report with the Treasury and notify the FBI. Although these laws and programs impose compliance costs and create privacy obligations and, in some cases, reporting obligations, these laws and programs do not materially affect the Bank s products, services or other business activities. Future Regulation . From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in the Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company or the Bank in substantial ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material effect on the business of the Company.

Set forth below is the range of high and low sales prices (adjusted for stock dividends and splits), as reported by Nasdaq, for each full quarterly period within the two most recent fiscal years. MARKET PRICE OF STOCK 2012 2011 Quarter High Low High Low First $ 9.66 $ 7.39 $ 6.37 $ 5.49 Second $ 9.13 $ 7.46 $ 6.09 $ 5.35 Third $ 8.83 $ 7.82 $ 6.55 $ 5.45 Fourth $ 9.49 $ 8.38 $ 7.88 $ 5.56 The Company has not paid cash dividends to its shareholders since 1995, electing to retain earnings for funding the growth of the Company and its business. The Company currently anticipates continuing the policy of retaining earnings. The ability of the Company to pay dividends, should it elect to do so, depends largely upon the ability of the Bank to declare and pay dividends to the Company, as the principal source of the Company s revenue is dividends paid by the Bank. Future dividends will depend primarily upon the Bank s earnings, financial condition, and need for funds, as well as governmental policies and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank, which limit the amount that may be paid as dividends without prior approval. In addition, under the Agreement between the Company and United discussed in more detail in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statement, the Company is restricted from paying dividends to its shareholders until the effective time of the merger. As of March 8, 2013, the Company had 498 stockholders of record, and an aggregate of approximately 2,300 beneficial owners. 102 Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans.
