These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of the Company s plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions that are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond the Company s control). The following factors, among others, could cause the Company s financial performance to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements: the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Parke Bank (the Bank ), conducts operations; the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, inflation, interest rates, market and monetary fluctuations; the timely development of and acceptance of new products and services of the Bank and the perceived overall value of these products and services by users, including the features, pricing and quality compared to competitors products and services; the impact of changes in financial services laws and regulations (including laws concerning taxes, banking, securities and insurance); technological changes; changes in consumer spending and saving habits; and the success of the Company at managing the risks resulting from these factors. The Company cautions that the listed factors are not exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company. PART I °Item 1. Business General The Company is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in January 2005 for the sole purpose of becoming the holding company of the Bank. The Company commenced operations on June 1, 2005, upon completion of the reorganization of the Bank into the holding company form of organization following approval of the reorganization by shareholders of the Bank at its 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Company s business and operations primarily consist of its ownership of the Bank. The Bank is a commercial bank, which commenced operations on January 28, 1999. The Bank is chartered by the New Jersey Department of Banking and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). The Company and the Bank maintain their principal offices at 601 Delsea Drive, Washington Township, New Jersey. The Bank also conducts business through offices in Northfield, Galloway Township and Washington Township, New Jersey, and in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Bank is a full service bank, with an emphasis on providing personal and business financial services to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses in Gloucester, Atlantic and Cape May Counties in New Jersey and the Philadelphia area in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2013, the Company had assets of $794.9 million, net loans of $636.0 million, deposits of $626.8 million and equity of $93.6 million. 1 The Bank focuses its commercial loan originations on small and mid-sized businesses (generally up to $25 million in annual sales). Commercial loan products include residential and commercial real estate construction loans; working capital loans and lines of credit; demand, term and time loans; and equipment, inventory and accounts receivable financing. Residential construction loans in tract development are also included in the commercial loan category. The Bank also offers a range of deposit products to its commercial customers. Commercial customers also have the ability to use overnight depository, ACH, wire transfer services and merchant capture electronic check processing services. The Bank s retail banking activities emphasize consumer deposit and checking accounts. An extensive range of these services is offered by the Bank to meet the varied needs of its customers in all age groups. In addition to traditional products and services, the Bank offers contemporary products and services, such as debit cards, Internet banking and online bill payment. Retail lending activities by the Bank include residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, fixed rate second mortgages, new and used auto loans and overdraft protection. Market Area Substantially all of the Bank s business is with customers in its market areas of Southern New Jersey and the Philadelphia area of Pennsylvania. Most of the Bank s customers are individuals and small and medium-sized businesses which are dependent upon the regional economy. Adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the Bank s markets could adversely affect the Bank s borrowers, their ability to repay their loans and to borrow additional funds, and consequently the Bank s financial condition and performance. Additionally, most of the Bank s loans are secured by real estate located in Southern New Jersey and the Philadelphia area. A decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the values of such real estate. Consequently, a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on the Bank s earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse. Competition The Bank faces significant competition, both in making loans and attracting deposits. The Bank s competition in both areas comes principally from other commercial banks, thrift and savings institutions, including savings and loan associations and credit unions, and other types of financial institutions, including brokerage firms and credit card companies. The Bank faces additional competition for deposits from short-term money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds. Most of the Bank s competitors, whether traditional or nontraditional financial institutions, have a longer history and significantly greater financial and marketing resources than does the Bank. Among the advantages certain of these institutions have over the Bank are their ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns, to access international money markets and to allocate their investment resources to regions of highest yield and demand. Major banks operating in the primary market area offer certain services, such as international banking and trust services, which are not offered directly by the Bank. In commercial transactions, the Bank s legal lending limit to a single borrower enables the Bank to compete effectively for the business of individuals and smaller enterprises. However, the Bank s legal lending limit is considerably lower than that of various competing institutions, which have substantially greater capitalization. The Bank has a relatively smaller capital base than most other competing institutions which, although above regulatory minimums, may constrain the Bank s effectiveness in competing for loans. 2 Lending Activities Composition of Loan Portfolio. Set forth below is selected data relating to the composition of the Bank s loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated. (1) As of December 31, 2013 no one industry sector concentration exceeded 10% of total loans. Refer to pages 4 through 6 for descriptions of the loan categories presented.

The Bank originates secured loans for business purposes. Loans are made to provide working capital to businesses in the form of lines of credit, which may be secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets. The financial condition and cash flow of commercial borrowers are closely monitored by means of corporate financial statements, personal financial statements and income tax returns. The frequency of submissions of required financial 4 information depends on the size and complexity of the credit and the collateral that secures the loan. The Bank s general policy is to obtain personal guarantees from the principals of the commercial loan borrowers. Such loans are made to businesses located in the Bank s market area. Commercial business loans generally involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the mobility of collateral, the effects of general economic conditions and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income and which are secured by real property the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Real Estate Development and Construction Loans. The Bank originates construction loans to individuals and real estate developers in its market area. The advantages of construction lending are that the market is typically less competitive than more standard mortgage products, the interest rate typically charged is a variable rate, which permits the Bank to protect against sudden changes in its costs of funds, and the fees or points charged by the Bank to its customers can be amortized over the shorter term of a construction loan, typically, one to two years, which permits the Bank to recognize income received over a shorter period of time. The Bank provides interim real estate acquisition development and construction loans to builders and developers. Real estate development and construction loans to provide interim financing on the property are based on acceptable percentages of the appraised value of the property securing the loan in each case. Real estate development and construction loan funds are disbursed periodically at pre-specified stages of completion. Interest rates on these loans are generally adjustable. The Bank carefully monitors these loans with on-site inspections and control of disbursements. These loans are generally made on properties located in the Bank s market area. Development and construction loans are secured by the properties under development and personal guarantees are typically obtained. Further, to assure that reliance is not placed solely in the value of the underlying property, the Bank considers the financial condition and reputation of the borrower and any guarantors, the amount of the borrower s equity in the project, independent appraisals, costs estimates and pre-construction sale information. Loans to residential builders are for the construction of residential homes for which a binding sales contract exists and the prospective buyers have been pre-qualified for permanent mortgage financing. Loans to residential developers are made only to developers with a proven sales record. Generally, these loans are extended only when the borrower provides evidence that the lots under development will be sold to potential buyers satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank also originates loans to individuals for construction of single family dwellings. These loans are for the construction of the individual s primary residence. They are typically secured by the property under construction, occasionally include additional collateral (such as a second mortgage on the borrower s present home), and commonly have maturities of six to twelve months. 5 Construction financing is labor intensive for the Bank, requiring employees of the Bank to expend substantial time and resources in monitoring and servicing each construction loan to completion. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and development, the accuracy of projections, such as the sales of homes or the future leasing of commercial space, and the accuracy of the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. Substantial deviations can occur in such projections. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. Also, a construction loan that is in default can cause problems for the Bank such as designating replacement builders for a project, considering alternate uses for the project and site and handling any structural and environmental issues that might arise. Commercial Real Estate Mortgage Loans. The Bank originates mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate. Such loans are primarily secured by office buildings, retail buildings, warehouses and general purpose business space. Although terms may vary, the Bank s commercial mortgages generally have maturities of twenty years, but re-price within five years. Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial and multi-family real estate lending is the borrower s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. The Bank seeks to reduce the risks associated with commercial mortgage lending by generally lending in its primary market area and obtaining periodic financial statements and tax returns from borrowers. It is also the Bank s general policy to obtain personal guarantees from the principals of the borrowers and assignments of all leases related to the collateral. Residential Real Estate Mortgage Loans. The Bank originates adjustable and fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. Such mortgage loans are generally originated under terms, conditions and documentation acceptable to the secondary mortgage market. Although the Bank has placed all of these loans into its portfolio, a substantial majority of such loans can be sold in the secondary market or pledged for potential borrowings. Consumer Loans. The Bank offers a variety of consumer loans. These loans are typically secured by residential real estate or personal property, including automobiles. Home equity loans (closed-end and lines of credit) are typically made up to 80% of the appraised or assessed value of the property securing the loan in each case, less the amount of any existing prior liens on the property, and generally have maximum terms of ten years, although the Bank does offer a 90% loan to value product if certain conditions related to the borrower and property are satisfied. The interest rates on second mortgages are generally fixed, while interest rates on home equity lines of credit are variable. Loans to One Borrower. Federal regulations limit loans to one borrower in an amount equal to 15% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. At December 31, 2013, the Bank s loan to one borrower limit was approximately $18.7 million and the Bank had no borrowers with loan balances in 6 excess of this amount. At December 31, 2013, the Bank s largest loan to one borrower was a loan for commercial real estate, with a balance of $13.0 million that was secured by the real estate. At December 31, 2013, this loan was current and performing in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. The size of loans which the Bank can offer to potential borrowers is less than the size of loans which many of the Bank s competitors with larger capitalization are able to offer. The Bank may engage in loan participations with other banks for loans in excess of the Bank s legal lending limits. However, no assurance can be given that such participations will be available at all or on terms which are favorable to the Bank and its customers. Non-Performing and Problem Assets Non-Performing Assets. Non-accrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status if, in the opinion of management, collection is doubtful, or when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more unless the collateral is considered sufficient to cover principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection. Interest accrued, but not collected at the date a loan is placed on non-accrual status, is reversed and charged against interest income. Subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal or recorded as interest income, depending on management s assessment of ultimate collectibility of principal and interest. Loans are returned to an accrual status when the borrower s ability to make periodic principal and interest payments has returned to normal (i.e., brought current with respect to principal or interest or restructured) and the paying capacity of the borrower and/or the underlying collateral is deemed sufficient to cover principal and interest. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future discounted cash flows, the market price of the loan or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The recognition of interest income on impaired loans is the same as for non-accrual loans discussed above. Total impaired loans, which include non-accrual loans, were $68.9 million, $87.6 million, $97.2 million, $112.0 million and $50.9 million at December 31 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Included in impaired loans at December 31, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $51.0 million, $67.1 million, $66.9 million and $42.7 million of loans classified as troubled debt restructurings as defined within accounting guidance and regulatory literature. The Company did not have any loans classified as troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2009. 7 The following table sets forth information regarding non-accrual loans at the dates indicated. At December 31, 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) Loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis: Commercial and Industrial $ 122 $ 248 $ $ $ 350 Real Estate Construction: Residential 967 799 5,265 8,546 18,895 Commercial 9,908 12,958 7,703 6,701 198 Real Estate Mortgage: Commercial - Owner Occupied 976 1,218 4,797 546 2,479 Commercial - Non-Owner Occupied 10,853 19,228 18,132 826 902 Residential - 1 to 4 Family 12,914 10,072 7,691 9,415 2,511 Residential - Multifamily 99 2,838 597 1,350 Consumer 115 188 274 61 117 Total non-accrual loans 35,954 47,549 44,459 27,445 25,452 Accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more: Commercial and Industrial Real Estate Construction: Residential Commercial Real Estate Mortgage: Commercial - Owner Occupied Commercial - Non-Owner Occupied Residential - 1 to 4 Family Residential - Multifamily Consumer Total Total non-performing loans $ 35,954 $ 47,549 $ 44,459 $ 27,445 $ 25,452 Total non-performing loans as a percentage of loans 5.5 % 7.6 % 7.1 % 4.4 % 4.2 % When a loan is more than 30 days delinquent, the borrower is contacted by mail or phone and payment is requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower. In certain instances, the Company may modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize their financial affairs. If the loan continues in a delinquent status for 90 days or more, the Company generally will initiate foreclosure proceedings. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on non-accrual status is charged against interest income. Such interest, when ultimately collected, is applied either to the outstanding principal or recorded as interest income, depending on management s assessment of ultimate collectibility of principal and interest. At December 31, 2013, the Bank had $36.0 million of loans that were on a non-accrual basis. Gross interest income of $2.1 million would have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013 if these loans had been performing in accordance with their terms. Interest income of $30 thousand was recognized on these loans during the year ended December 31, 2013. 8 Classified Assets. Federal Regulations provide for a classification system for problem assets of insured institutions. Under this classification system, problem assets of insured institutions are classified as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it involves more than an acceptable level of risk due to a deteriorating financial condition, unfavorable history of the borrower, inadequate payment capacity, insufficient security or other negative factors within the industry, market or management. Substandard loans have clearly defined weaknesses that can jeopardize the timely payments of the loan. Assets classified as doubtful exhibit all of the weaknesses defined under the Substandard Category but with enough risk to present a high probability of some principal loss on the loan, although not yet fully ascertainable in amount. Assets classified as loss are those considered un-collectable or of little value, even though a collection effort may continue after the classification and potential charge-off. The Bank also internally classifies certain assets as other assets especially mentioned (OAEM) , such assets do not demonstrate a current potential for loss but are monitored in response to negative trends which, if not reversed, could lead to a substandard rating in the future. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish specific allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required either to establish an allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the assets so classified or to charge off such amount. All of the Bank s loans rated substandard and worse are also on non-accrual and deemed impaired. At December 31, 2013, the Bank had assets classified as follows: Loan Balance (Amounts in thousands) Special mention $ 18,023 Substandard 51,470 Doubtful Loss $ 69,493 Foreclosed Real Estate. Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. When real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at or its fair value less disposal costs. Management also periodically performs valuations of real estate owned and establishes allowances to reduce book values of the properties to their net realizable values when necessary. Any write-down of real estate owned is charged to operations. Real estate owned at December 31, 2013 was $28.9 million. The real estate owned consisted of 28 properties, the largest being a condominium development located in Absecon, New Jersey at $10.6 million. Allowance for Losses on Loans. It is the policy of management to provide for possible losses on all loans in its portfolio, whether classified or not. A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s evaluation of the inherent losses estimated to have occurred in the Bank s loan portfolio. Management s judgment as to the level of probable losses on existing loans is based on its internal review of the loan portfolio, including an analysis of the borrowers current financial position; the level and trends in delinquencies, non-accruals and impaired loans; the consideration of national and local 9 economic conditions and trends; concentrations of credit; the impact of any changes in credit policy; the experience and depth of management and the lending staff; and any trends in loan volume and terms. In determining the collectibility of certain loans, management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral. However, management s determination of the appropriate allowance level which is based upon the factors outlined above, which are believed to be reasonable, may or may not prove to be valid. Thus, there can be no assurance that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required. The following table sets forth information with respect to the Bank s allowance for losses on loans at the dates and for the periods indicated.

Deposits are the major external source of the Bank s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from the amortization, prepayment or sale of loans, maturities of investment securities and operations. Scheduled loan principal repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and market conditions. Deposits. The Bank offers individuals and businesses a wide variety of accounts, including checking, savings, money market accounts, individual retirement accounts and certificates of deposit. Deposits are obtained primarily from communities that the Bank serves, however, the Bank held brokered deposits of $5.2 million and $21.8 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Brokered deposits are a more volatile source of funding than core deposits and do not increase the deposit franchise of the Bank. In a rising rate environment, the Bank may be unwilling or unable to pay a competitive rate. To the extent that such deposits do not remain with the Bank, they may need to be replaced with borrowings which could increase the Bank s cost of funds and negatively impact its interest rate spread, financial condition and results of operation. To mitigate the potential negative impact associated with brokered deposits, the Bank joined Promontory Interfinancial Network during 2007 to secure an additional alternative funding source. Promontory provides the Bank an additional source of external funds through their weekly CDARS TM settlement process. The rates are comparable to brokered deposits and can be obtained within a shorter period time than brokered deposits. The Bank s CDARS TM deposits included within the brokered deposit total amounted to $5.2 million, $21.8 million and $22.9 million at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following tables detail the average amount, the average rate paid, and the percentage of each category to total deposits for the most recent three years ended December 31. 2013 Average Balance Yield/Rate Percent of Total (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) NOWs $ 23,635 0.54 % 3.82 % Money markets 85,542 0.66 % 13.81 Savings 232,635 0.68 % 37.56 Time deposits 234,822 1.11 % 37.91 Brokered CDs 12,000 1.19 % 1.94 Total interest-bearing deposits 588,634 0.85 % Non-interest bearing demand deposits 30,714 4.96 Total deposits $ 619,348 100.00 % 14 2012 Average Balance Yield/Rate Percent of Total (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) NOWs $ 19,905 0.68 % 3.09 % Money markets 92,068 0.80 % 14.29 Savings 223,560 0.88 % 34.69 Time deposits 256,326 1.32 % 39.77 Brokered CDs 23,458 1.13 % 3.64 Total interest-bearing deposits 615,317 1.05 % Non-interest bearing demand deposits 29,157 4.52 Total deposits $ 644,474 100.00 % 2011 Average Balance Yield/Rate Percent of Total (Amounts in thousands, except percentages) NOWs $ 15,972 0.95 % 2.64 % Money markets 90,860 1.06 % 15.01 Savings 197,069 1.22 % 32.55 Time deposits 234,068 1.52 % 38.66 Brokered CDs 44,101 1.82 % 7.28 Total interest-bearing deposits 582,070 1.35 % 96.14 Non-interest bearing demand deposits 23,357 3.86 Total deposits $ 605,427 100.00 % The following table indicates the amount of the Bank s certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more by time remaining until maturity as of December 31, 2013.

Borrowings from the FHLB outstanding during 2013, 2012, and 2011 had maturities of ten years or less and cannot be prepaid without penalty. 15 The following table sets forth information regarding the Bank s borrowings: December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (Amounts in thousands, except rates) Amount outstanding at year end $ 68,683 $ 43,851 $ 74,010 Weighted average interest rates at year end 1.80 % 2.04 % 1.39 % Maximum outstanding at any month end $ 68,683 $ 53,997 $ 74,010 Average outstanding $ 42,307 $ 46,165 $ 64,519 Weighted average interest rate during the year 1.35 % 2.04 % 2.10 % Subsidiary Activities The largest subsidiary of the Company is the Bank. The Bank has a subsidiary, Parke Capital Markets, a corporation, which was formed in 2001 to generate fee income from capital markets financing activities, which include term financings. 44 Business Capital LLC was formed in 2009 for the purpose of originating and servicing Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. The Bank has a 51% ownership interest. Personnel At December 31, 2013, the Bank had 63 full-time and 16 part-time employees. Regulation Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws that relate to the regulation of the Bank and the Company. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. Holding Company Regulation General. The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the BHC Act ), and is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board ). The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over the Company and the Company s non-bank subsidiaries which also permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary bank. This regulation and oversight is intended primarily for the protection of the depositors of the Bank and not for shareholders of the Company. As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and any additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require under the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve Board will also examine the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the BHC Act on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or other securities of the bank holding company or its subsidiaries, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Furthermore, under amendments to the BHC Act and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or provision of credit or providing any property or services. Generally, this provision provides that a bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any service to a customer on the condition that the 16 customer provide additional credit or service to the bank, to the bank holding company, or to any other subsidiary of the bank holding company or on the condition that the customer not obtain other credit or service from a competitor of the bank, the bank holding company, or any subsidiary of the bank. Extensions of credit by the Bank to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of the Bank or any affiliate thereof, including the Company, are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, which among other things, generally prohibits loans to any such individual where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of a bank s unimpaired capital and surplus, plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Federal Securities Law. The Company s common stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ), and the Company is subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of Section 12(b) of the 1934 Act, as amended. Non-Banking Activities. The business activities of the Company, as a bank holding company, are restricted by the BHCA. Under the BHC Act and the Federal Reserve Board s bank holding company regulations, the Company may only engage in, or acquire or control voting securities or assets of a company engaged in, (1) banking or managing or controlling banks and other subsidiaries authorized under the BHC Act and (2) any BHCA activity the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks to be a proper incident thereto. These include any incidental activities necessary to carry on those activities, as well as a lengthy list of activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Financial Modernization. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act permits greater affiliation among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other companies under a new type of financial services company known as a financial holding company. A financial holding company essentially is a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers. Financial holding companies are authorized by statute to engage in a number of financial activities previously impermissible for bank holding companies, including securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; and merchant banking activities. The Act also permits the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to authorize additional activities for financial holding companies if they are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if it and each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized and well managed, and each of its subsidiary banks has at least a satisfactory CRA rating. A financial holding company must provide notice to the Federal Reserve within 30 days after commencing activities previously determined by statute or by the Federal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury to be permissible. The Company has not submitted notice to the Federal Reserve Board of its intent to be deemed a financial holding company. Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the BHCA. The Federal Reserve s capital adequacy guidelines are similar to those imposed on the Bank by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). See Regulation of the Bank-Regulatory Capital Requirements and Recent Amendments to Regulatory Capital Requirements. 17 Regulation of the Bank The Bank operates in a highly regulated industry. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors and not shareholders of the Bank. Any change in applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, whether by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC ), or the United States Congress could have a material adverse impact on the Bank, and its operations. The adoption of regulations or the enactment of laws that restrict the operations of the Bank or impose burdensome requirements upon it could reduce its profitability and could impair the value of the Bank s franchise which could hurt the trading price of the Bank s stock. As a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision, and control of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and control of the FDIC, an agency of the federal government. The regulations of the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance affect virtually all activities of the Bank, including the minimum level of capital the Bank must maintain, the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, the ability of the Bank to expand through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters. The FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance Consent Orders. On April 9, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Bank entered into Consent Orders with each of the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. Under the Consent Orders, the terms of which are substantially identical, the Bank was required, among other things, subject to review and approval by the FDIC and the Department of Banking and Insurance: (i) to adopt and implement a plan to reduce the Bank s interest in delinquent or classified assets; (ii) to engage a third party firm to conduct a review of all credits originated, extended or restructured with the use of interest reserves and/or interest-only conditions and to identify related repayment risks and regulatory accounting standards; (iii) adopt and implement a program providing for a periodic independent review of the Bank s loan portfolio; ( iv) conduct a review of the Bank s loan policies and procedures; and (v) to adopt and implement a program to reduce and manage each of the concentrations of credit identified by the FDIC and the Department of Banking and Insurance. The Consent Orders also require the Bank to obtain the prior approval of the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance before declaring or paying any dividend or appointing or changing the title or responsibilities of any director or senior executive officer. Additional regulatory provisions require FDIC prior approval before the Bank enters into any employment agreement or other agreement or plan providing for the payment of a golden parachute payment or the making of any golden parachute payment. Federal Reserve Bank Memorandum of Understanding . On December 18, 2012, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (the Federal Reserve Bank ). Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, the Company must: (i) submit an updated comprehensive capital plan to address the Bank s long-term capital needs and the repayment of the Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) not pay any common stock dividend or pay interest on our outstanding trust preferred securities without prior Federal Reserve Bank approval if the Bank is less than well capitalized or the payment would cause it to be less than well capitalized; (iii) not redeem any securities without prior Federal Reserve Bank approval or incur any debt with a maturity greater than one year; and (iv) submit various budget and cash flow projections and other reports. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with the terms of the MOU. 18 Federal Deposit Insurance. The Bank s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum deposit insurance amount has been permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000 and unlimited deposit insurance has been extended to non-interest-bearing transaction accounts until December 31, 2013. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institution s ranking in one of four risk categories based on their examination ratings and capital ratios. Starting in 2009, the FDIC significantly raised the assessment rate in order to restore the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund to the statutory minimum of 1.15%. The FDIC imposed a special assessment equal to five basis points of assets less Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009 payable on September 30, 2009 and reserved the right to impose additional special assessments. In lieu of further special assessments, on November 12, 2009 the FDIC required all insured depository institutions to prepay their estimated risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010, 2011, and 2012 on December 30, 2009. For purposes of estimating future assessments, an institution would assume 5% annual growth in the assessment base and a three basis point increase in the current assessment rate for 2011 and 2012. The prepaid assessment would be applied against the actual assessment until exhausted. Any funds remaining after June 30, 2013 were returned to the institution. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to take such steps as necessary to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020. In setting the assessments, the FDIC is required to offset the effect of the higher reserve ratio against insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments so that assessments will be based on the average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital of a financial institution rather than on its insured deposits. The FDIC has adopted a new restoration plan to increase the reserve ratio to 1.15% by September 30, 2020 with new rules implemented in 2011 regarding the method to be used to achieve a 1.35% reserve ratio by that date and offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion in assets. Pursuant to these requirements, the FDIC has adopted new assessment regulations that redefine the assessment base as average consolidated assets less average tangible equity. Insured banks with more than $1.0 billion in assets must calculate quarterly average assets based on daily balances while smaller banks and newly chartered banks may use weekly averages. In the case of a merger, the average assets of the surviving bank for the quarter must include the average assets of the merged institution for the period in the quarter prior to the merger. Average assets would be reduced by goodwill and other intangibles. Average tangible equity will equal Tier 1 capital. For institutions with more than $1.0 billion in assets average tangible equity will be calculated on a weekly basis while smaller institutions may use the quarter-end balance. Beginning April 1, 2011, the base assessment rate for insured institutions in Risk Category I ranged between 5 to 9 basis points and for institutions in Risk Categories II, III, and IV will be 14, 23 and 35 basis points. An institution s assessment rate is reduced based on the amount of its outstanding unsecured long-term debt and for institutions in Risk Categories II, III and IV may be increased based on their brokered deposits. Risk Categories are eliminated for institutions with more than $10 billion in assets which will be assessed at a rate between 5 and 35 basis points. In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation ( FICO ), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The FICO assessment rates, which are determined quarterly, averaged 0.0062% of insured deposits on an annualized basis in fiscal year 2013. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017. 19 Capital Adequacy Guidelines. Parke Bancorp (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank are subject to risk-based capital guidelines promulgated by the FDIC that are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under the guidelines, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. The minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least 4% of the total capital is required to be Tier I Capital, consisting of common shareholders equity and qualifying preferred stock, less certain goodwill items and other intangible assets. The remainder ( Tier II Capital ) may consist of (a) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, (b) excess of qualifying preferred stock, (c) hybrid capital instruments, (d) perpetual debt, (e) mandatory convertible securities, and (f) qualifying subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock up to 50% of Tier I capital. Total capital is the sum of Tier I and Tier II capital less reciprocal holdings of other banking organizations, capital instruments, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and any other deductions as determined by the FDIC (determined on a case-by-case basis or as a matter of policy after formal rule-making). In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the FDIC has adopted a minimum Tier I capital (leverage) ratio, under which a bank must maintain a minimum level of Tier I capital to average total consolidated assets of at least 3% in the case of a bank that has the highest regulatory examination rating and is not contemplating significant growth or expansion. All other banks are expected to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 100 to 200 basis points above the stated minimum. At December 31, 2013, the Bank had the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized. Recent Amendments to Regulatory Capital Requirements In July 2013, the federal banking agencies approved amendments to their regulatory capital rules to conform them with the international regulatory standards agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the accord often referred to as Basel III . The revisions establish new higher capital ratio requirements, tighten the definitions of capital, impose new operating restrictions on banking organizations with insufficient capital buffers and increase the risk weighting of certain assets. The new capital requirements will apply to all banks and savings associations, bank holding companies with more than $500 million in assets and all savings and loan holding companies (other than certain savings and loan holding companies engaged in insurance underwriting and grandfathered diversified holding companies) regardless of asset size. The rules will become effective for the institutions with assets over $250 billion and internationally active institutions starting in January 2014 and will become effective for all other institutions beginning in January 2015. The following discussion summarizes the changes which are believed most likely to affect the Company and the Bank. New and Higher Capital Requirements. The regulations establish a new capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 Capital which will consist of common stock instruments and related surplus (net of treasury stock), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and, subject to certain adjustments, minority common equity interests in subsidiaries. Unlike the current rules which exclude unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities from regulatory capital, the amended rules would require accumulated other comprehensive income to flow through to regulatory capital unless a one-time, irrevocable opt-out election is made in the first regulatory reporting period under the new rule. Depository institutions and their holding companies will be required to maintain Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets by 2015. 20 The regulations increase the required ratio of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets from the current 4% to 6% by 2015. Tier 1 Capital will consist of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital plus Additional Tier 1 Capital elements which would include non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. Cumulative preferred stock (other than cumulative preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program or the Small Business Lending Fund) will no longer qualify as Additional Tier 1 Capital. Trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying capital instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank and savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009 or by mutual holding companies may continue to be included in Tier 1 Capital but will be phased out over 10 years beginning in 2016 for all other banking organizations. These non-qualifying capital instruments, however, may be included in Tier 2 Capital which could also include qualifying subordinated debt. The amended regulations also require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions, eliminating the 3% option for institutions with the highest supervisory ratings. The minimum required ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets will remain at 8%. Capital Conservation Buffer Requirement. In addition to higher capital requirements, depository institutions and their holding companies will be required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in over four years beginning in 2016. The capital conservation buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% Total Capital on a fully phased-in basis. Changes to Prompt Corrective Action Capital Categories. The Prompt Corrective Action rules will be amended effective January 1, 2015 to incorporate a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital requirement and to raise the capital requirements for certain capital categories. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization will be required to have at least an 8% Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, a 6% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, a 4.5% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio and a 4% Tier 1 Leverage Ratio. To be well capitalized, a banking organization will be required to have at least a 10% Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, an 8% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, a 6.5% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio and a 5% Tier 1 Leverage Ratio. Federal savings associations will be required to calculate their prompt corrective action capital ratios in the same manner as national banks. Accordingly, tangible equity ratios will be based on average total assets rather than period-end total assets. Additional Deductions from Capital. Banking organizations will be required to deduct goodwill and other intangible assets (other than certain mortgage servicing assets), net of associated deferred tax liabilities, from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. Deferred tax assets arising from temporary timing differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks will continue to be deducted. Deferred tax assets that can be realized through NOL carrybacks will not be deducted but will be subject to 100% risk weighting. Defined benefit pension fund assets, net of any associated deferred tax liability, will be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital unless the banking organization has unrestricted and unfettered access to such assets. Reciprocal cross-holdings of capital instruments in any other financial institutions will now be deducted from capital, not just holdings in other depository institutions. For this purpose, financial institutions are broadly defined to include securities and commodities firms, hedge and private equity funds and non-depository lenders. Banking organizations will also be required to deduct non-significant investments (less than 10% of outstanding stock) in the capital of other financial institutions (including investments in trust preferred securities) to the extent these exceed 10% of 21 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital subject to a 15% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital cap. Greater than 10% investments must be deducted if they exceed 10% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. If the aggregate amount of certain items excluded from capital deduction due to a 10% threshold exceeds 17.65% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, the excess must be deducted. Savings associations will continue to be required to deduct investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities not permitted for national banks. Changes in Risk-Weightings. The federal banking agencies did not adopt a proposed rule that would have significantly changed the risk-weighting for residential mortgages. Instead, the amended regulations will continue to follow the previous capital rules which assign a 50% risk-weighting to qualifying mortgage loans which generally consist of residential first mortgages with an 80% loan-to-value ratio (or which carry mortgage insurance that reduces the bank s exposure to 80%) that are not more than 90 days past due. All other mortgage loans will have a 100% risk weight. The revised regulations apply a 250% risk-weighting to mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets that cannot be realized through NOL carrybacks and investments in the capital instruments of other financial institutions that are not deducted from capital. The revised regulations also create a new 150% risk-weighting category for high volatility commercial real estate loans which are credit facilities for the acquisition, construction or development of real property other than for certain community development projects, agricultural land and one- to four-family residential properties or commercial real projects where: (i) the loan-to-value ratio is not in excess of interagency real estate lending standards; and (ii) the borrower has contributed capital equal to not less than 15% of the real estate s as completed value before the loan is made. °Item 1A.
