MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Our common stock is not traded on any exchange. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, under the trading symbol CBIS.OB . The market for our stock is highly volatile. We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our common stock. The OTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed and traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Bulletin Board securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Bulletin Board stocks are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange. The following table shows the high and low prices of our common shares on the OTC Bulletin Board for each quarter within the two most recent fiscal years. The following quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions: Fiscal Year Ending December 2012 HIGH LOW Quarter Ending March 31, 2012 0.17 0.09 Quarter Ending June 30, 2012 0.17 0.05 Quarter Ending September 30, 2012 0.03 0.06 Quarter Ending December 31, 2012 0.09 0.04 Fiscal Year Ending December 2013 HIGH LOW Quarter Ending March 31, 2013 0.12 0.05 Quarter Ending June 30, 2013 0.07 0.03 Quarter Ending September 30, 2013 0.05 0.04 Quarter Ending December 31, 2013 0.05 0.03 3 Holders As of December 31, 2013, there were 512 stockholders of record, including CEDE Co., which holds shares for the beneficial interest of an unknown number of stockholders in brokerage accounts. Dividends The Company declared a dividend to all common stockholders of record as of December 31, 2010, whom are to receive a dividend equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the number of common shares of the Company s stock held on that date in the form of newly issued Series A common shares. For example, if a stockholder held 100,000 common shares on December 31, 2010, that stockholder would receive a dividend of 10,000 Series A common shares. This dividend is on hold and will remain pending until such time as FINRA approves the Company s Series A common stock for trading, it obtains a CUSIP registration number, it receives sponsorship from a brokerage firm, and the shares become tradable through the OTCBB market. The Company retains the right to adjust the shareholder record date should any factor make it impossible for the Company to issue the dividend to shareholders of record on December 31, 2010, including, but not limited to: approval of the Series A common stock and dividend by FINRA, a detailed December 31, 2010 common stockholder lists is available, or other unforeseen obstacles that would prevent the current dividend structure from completing. The Company will not make any share accrual or allowance for this dividend until such time as all regulatory approvals are in place for the Series A common stock to be issued and become a marketable security. The Company does not anticipate paying cash dividends or making distributions in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain and reinvest future earnings, if any, to finance and expand our operations.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. When used in this Form 10-K, the words "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions including the possibility that the Company's proposed plan of operation will fail to generate projected revenues. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those set forth on the forward looking statements as a result of the risks set forth in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, general economic conditions, and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statements. General The Company is committed to research and development of cannabis based medicines ("Products") and intends to pursue Independent New Drug certification, possibly under the Orphan Drug Act, for such treatments but faces two significant challenges in accomplishing this business objective, namely financing and government regulation. The Company is undercapitalized, and will be reliant on outside financing from sales of securities or issuance of debt instruments. Management expects many traditional lenders will be reluctant to provide the Company with capital in light of its financial condition and the nature of its expected business; so that any financing activities will likely be expensive and result in dilution to stockholders of the Company. In this regard, it should be noted that the Asset Acquisition Agreement among Cannex, the Company and K D Equity Investments, Inc. contains non-dilution provisions that provided additional shares to K D in the event our shares are sold privately for less than $1.00 per share. The Company can make no representation that financing for its business will be available, regardless of cost. Furthermore, although cannabis has been used for medicinal purposes for over 5,000 years, there is a significant prejudice against development of smoked cannabis medical products amongst the medical and law enforcement communities. In spite of recent statements by the current administration that indicate a softening of these views, marijuana is still classified as a Class 1 controlled substance. The Company can provide no assurances that it can develop and market its intended product, or how long government approval, if obtained, will take. Recent Developments Cannabis Science has added several experts to its scientific advisor board and other offices to enable it to progress towards FDA trials and similar efforts in other countries with its three key drugs under development, namely CS-TATI-1 targeting both newly diagnosed and treatment-experienced patients with drug-resistant HIV strains, as well as those intolerant of currently available therapies, CS-S/BCC-1 targeting basal and squamous cell carcinomas, and a proprietary cannabis-based therapy for neurological conditions that was patented in 2013. The Company established wholly owned subsidiaries in The Netherlands with an office in Haarlem, The Netherlands, to expand operations in Europe, including to enhance opportunities for studies and governmental approvals on an international basis. The Company is laying a solid foundation for entrance into the FDA and other government regulatory agencies for developing medicines for cancer, autism, Influenza, PTSD and other ailments. The Company's goal is the development of governmentally approved pharmaceuticals, including the aforementioned CS-TATI1, CS-S/BCC-1, and proprietary, patented neurological therapy currently under study or development. The Company faces not only the challenges of other business at an early stage of development, but special problems arising from the nature of its own business. Notwithstanding, stockholders and prospective stockholders should recognize that any investment in our Company is risky and speculative, and could result in a total loss. 6 Results of Operations Limited Revenues During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 we generated license revenues of $76,938 and educational and consulting revenue of $5,606 compared to $25,000 in license revenue and $11,575 in educational and consulting revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2013, we had an accumulated deficit of $92,508,542. At this time, our ability to generate any significant revenues continues to be uncertain. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Net Loss Our net loss decreased from $16,037,572 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 to $5,934,301 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 representing a decrease of $10,103,271. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, our net loss per share was $0.01, compared to a net loss per share of $0.05 per share for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. Expenses Total operating expenses decreased from $8,412,158 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 to $3,447,487 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 representing a decrease of $4,844,526. Bad debt expense increased from $0 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 to $143,062 for 2013 resulting from a provision for uncollected license fees. Our investor relations expenses decreased from $111,634 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 to $0 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease is due to a decrease in stock related compensation for investor relations engagements in 2012 compared to 2013. Our professional fees decreased $147,615 to $114,267 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $261,852 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was due to reduced legal services under agreements and other legal associated with increase securities filing activity and business ventures. The loss on settlement of debt decreased from $10,654,433 for the year ended December 31, 2012 to $2,305,650 in 2013. This decrease was due to decreased settlement of debt through stock and resulting losses on the settlements. Our general and administrative expenses decreased by $1,854,950 from $5,068,446 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 to $3,213,496 for the same period ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to a decrease in management and consulting fees relating to stock issued pursuant to agreements with management and consultants of the Company. Other general and administrative expenses consist of advertising, office supplies, transfer agent costs, travel expenses, rent, communication expenses (cellular, internet, fax, and telephone), office maintenance, courier and postage costs and office equipment. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2013, our current assets totaled $302,955 which was comprised of $943 in cash and cash equivalents, $697 in accounts receivable, $76,315 in accounts receivable-related party, and $225,000 in marketable securities. As of December 31, 2013, we had $206,709 in intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, $66,274 in goodwill, and $1,516 in property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation. As of December 31, 2013 we had a working capital deficit of $3,793,318. Our net loss of $5,934,301 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 was mostly funded by debt financing. We expect to incur substantial losses over the next two years. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 our cash position decreased by $22,617. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, we received net cash of $446,495 from financing activities compared to $813,445 for the same period in 2012. We used net cash of $432,467 in operating activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $640,342 for the same period in 2012. And we used net cash of $36,745 in investing activities compared for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 compared to using net cash of $151,740 for the same period in 2012. On March 8, 2014, the Company issued a private placement offering for 4,000,000 units at $0.25 per unit. Each unit is comprised of one share of common stock and one non-transferable warrant with each one warrant to purchase one share of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.50. The warrants shall expire 2 years from the date of issuance of the warrant certificate (collectively Offered Units ). As of April 9, 2014, the Company received all of the $1,000,000 into its corporate bank account for the Offered Units. The net offering proceeds were $995,000 after issuance costs. The Company is currently in the process of issuing shares and delivering warrants to investors who participated in the offering. On March 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Debt Extension Agreement with Intrinsic Venture Corp. to avoid default on promissory notes due to extend due dates by 12 months on all promissory notes and all notes becoming due in fiscal 2014. The Company is issuing 5,000,000 rule 144 restricted shares with a fair market value of $0.1666 per share or $833,000 as consideration for the extensions on the aforementioned promissory notes. The Company is currently not in good short-term financial standing. We anticipate that we may only generate any limited revenues in the near future and we will not have enough positive internal operating cash flow until we can generate substantial revenues, which may take the next two years to fully realize. There is no assurance we will achieve profitable operations. We have historically financed our operations primarily by cash flows generated from the sale of our equity securities and through cash infusions from officers and outside investors in exchange for debt and/or common stock. 7 Business Development Our business and product development will follow two parallel paths. We will create cannabis pharmaceuticals with and without psychoactive properties. Both of these lines will have numerous proven health benefits for treating autism, blood pressure, cancer and cancer side effects, along with other illnesses, including for general health maintenance. We are positioned to pursue the development of phytocannabinoid-based pharmaceutical grade products. The endocannabinoid system normally regulates blood pressure through its capacity to dilate blood vessels and reduce adrenergic stimuli. Additionally, there is a developing body of evidence that shows both the tumor killing properties of endo- and phyto- cannabinoids, and their ability to inhibit metastasis in a variety of cancers. The Company is working to navigate the regulatory framework for its phytocannabinoid science towards developing cannabis-based therapeutics that will holistically promote health by restoring biochemical balance. By adhering to underlying scientific principles, the Company will manipulate all-pervasive phytocannabinoid processes to target a variety of disparate illnesses. Cannabis Science is also positioning to explore insights that indicate an intrinsic link between novel cancer and HIV technologies and the cannabinoid system; with the goal of demonstrating that our pharmaceuticals will enhance biochemical markers that are indicative of a successful HIV therapy based on recent paradigm breaking discoveries. The Company is currently focused on FDA approval of its first medical cannabis product targeted for veterans. Many veterans are already using herbal cannabis to self-medicate to relieve the symptoms of PTSD. Consequently, there is a clear need for standardized, FDA approved, oral cannabis products which can, and should be, provided to veterans and others who can benefit from its use. Medical cannabis has far fewer and milder side effects than most currently prescribed pharmaceutical products do. We are working hard to have one or more products ready for FDA clinical trials as soon as possible. On February 9, 2012, the Company signed a license agreement with Apothecary to produce several Cannabis Science Brand Formulations for the California medical cannabis market. As well, Apothecary will provide research and development facilities with full circle operations including a California laboratory facility for internal research and development, along with 16 unique genetic strains specifically generated and maintained by a cancer survivor who recognizes the importance of proper growth and breeding in addition to investing $250,000 in research and development in the first 24 months. Apothecary failed to meet several contract provisions including investing $250,000 in R D, setting up a laboratory facility, and reporting and remitting license fees owing to the Company. We are currently in negotiations with Apothecary to avoid legal action and enforcement of the license agreement. On February 9, 2012, the Company acquired GGECO University, Inc. ( GGECO ), an online video-based medical cannabis education system, offering courses dealing with medical cannabis law, the benefits of medical marijuana, cooking, horticulture, and bud tending. Following the university's name change to Cannabis Science University, the Company hopes to use this platform to educate the general public, patients, and even those who have already been involved in the medical cannabis industry on the medical benefits of cannabis, how it is grown, how to use it safely, and the many applications or ways to administer the medication. In consideration of this agreement, the Company issued 25,000,000 common shares to the principals of GGECO. On March 21, 2012, the Company acquired Cannabis Consulting Inc. ( CCI Group ), which consists of a group of businesses operated by Robert J. Kane, including: all contracted rights, properties, patents, trademarks, and distribution rights and agreements pertaining to Cannabis Consulting Inc., Robert Kane Partners, Kaneabis Consulting, Kaneabis Fund, Kaneabis Report, and Kaneabis Radio. In conjunction with the acquisitions, Robert Kane was promoted to V.P. of Investor Relations for the Company. Consideration paid for the CCI Group was 1,000,000 common shares with a fair market value of $147,000 issued to the principal, Mr. Robert Kane. On February 13, 2014, the Company entered into a partnership agreement with Michigan Green Technologies, LLC. Under the agreement, the Company participates in 20% of all net profit of the operating entity. In addition, the Company is working with its partner to active lobbying for the legalization of hemp and cannabis in Michigan which will lead to additional business opportunities for the Company through its partnership. The Company anticipates having to raise additional capital to fund operations over the next 12 months. To the extent that it is required to raise additional funds to acquire properties, and to cover costs of operations, the Company intends to do so through additional public or private offerings of debt or equity securities. As of December 31, 2013 the Company had one employee and four directors/executives under management services contracts. °Item 7A.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2013 C O N T E N T S Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm F-1 Consolidated Balance Sheets F-2 Consolidated Statements of Operations F-3 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity/(Deficit) F-4 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows F-7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements F-8 to F-16 9 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders Cannabis Science, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cannabis Science, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cannabis Science, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has substantial operating losses and has a working capital deficiency, both of which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. /s/ Turner, Stone Company, L.L.P. Certified Public Accountants Dallas, Texas April 21, 2014 F-1 CANNABIS SCIENCE, INC.

F-5 CANNABIS SCIENCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2013 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A. Organization and General Description of Business Cannabis Science, Inc. ( We or the Company ), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado, on February 29, 1996, as Patriot Holdings, Inc. On August 26, 1999, the Company changed its name to National Healthcare Technology, Inc. On June 6, 2007, the Company changed its name from National Healthcare Technology, Inc., to Brighton Oil Gas, Inc., and converted to a Nevada corporation. On March 25, 2008 the Company changed its name to Gulf Onshore, Inc. On April 7, 2009, the Company changed its name to Cannabis Science, Inc., and obtained a new CUSIP number. On May 7, 2009 the Company common shares commenced trading under the new stock symbol OTC: CBIS. Cannabis Science, Inc. is at the forefront of medical marijuana research and development with two key drugs under development, namely CS-TATI-1 targeting both newly diagnosed and treatment-experienced patients with drug-resistant HIV strains, as well as those intolerant of currently available therapies and CS-S/BCC-1 targeting basal and squamous cell carcinomas. The Company works with world authorities on phytocannabinoid science targeting critical illnesses, and adheres to scientific methodologies to develop, produce, and commercialize phytocannabinoid-based pharmaceutical products. In sum, we are dedicated to the creation of cannabis-based medicines, both with and without psychoactive properties, to treat disease and the symptoms of disease, as well as for general health maintenance. On November 15, 2013, the Company submitted a patent application N2010968 in Europe entitled "Composition for the Treatment of Neurobehavioral Disorders." The subject of the patent is development of cannabinoid-based formulations to treat a variety of neurobehavioral disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, and sleep disorders. B. Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company s fiscal year end is December 31. The operating results of GGECO University, Inc. ( GGECO ), acquired on February 9, 2012, for the period February 10, 2012 through December 31, 2013 were consolidated with the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. The s-type corporation of GGECO was dissolved in 2012 and all operations combined into the Company s. An independent valuation firm determined the intangibles acquired in GGECO to be $192,119 consisting of $150,000 for educational materials, $20,000 for the trade name, and $22,119 for the workforce. The total purchase price of $450,132, including acquired net liabilities, audit and valuation costs was recorded. A total of $66,274 in unimpaired goodwill remains at December 31, 2013. The operating results of Cannabis Consulting, Inc. ( CCI ), acquired on March 21, 2012, for the period March 21, 2012 through December 31, 2012 and January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 were consolidated with the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The s-type corporation of CCI was dissolved in 2012 and all operations combined into the Company s. The Company has allocated $125,000 of the purchase price to intangibles based on an internal valuation in addition to $22,000 of goodwill. No impairment in the fair market value of CCI was determined at December 31, 2013. In 2012, the Company formed Cannabis Science Europe GmbH ( CSE ) to operate joint-venture operations with dupetit Natural Products Ltd. The JV asset was sold to Endocan Corporation (formerly X-Change Corporation) on December 12, 2012. No operations had commenced at the time of sale of the JV asset. For the year ended December 31, 2013, CSE had minimal expenditures in the normal course of winding up the entity subsequent to the disposal of the JV asset. On May 6, 2013, the Company formed Cannabis Science International Holdings B.V. and on May 10, 2013, the Company formed Cannabis Science B.V. for the purpose of wholly-owned operating subsidiaries for the Company s European and world-wide operations. No business or operating activities have commenced in the subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013. F-6 C. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined. D. Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share Under ASC 260, "Earnings Per Share" ("EPS"), the Company provides for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic EPS includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings or losses of the entity. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, basic and diluted loss per share are the same since the calculation of diluted per share amounts would result in an anti-dilutive calculation. E. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. F. Long-Lived Assets Under ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment , the Company is required to periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used. ASC Topic 360 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for the cost of disposal. G. Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. Cost includes materials related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. H. Fair Value Measurements Under ASC Topic 820, the Company discloses the estimated fair values of financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for current assets and current liabilities qualifying as financial instruments are a reasonable estimate of fair value. In accordance with the reporting requirements of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, the Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under this standard and includes this additional information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments (see Note 4). The estimated fair value of other current assets and current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes. I. Technology License and Royalties The Company's former principal business activity focused on oil and gas exploration. We have divested ourselves of all oil and gas properties and are investigating other business opportunities. We have no technology licenses or rights to any royalties for formerly owned oil and gas properties. J. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Under ASC Topic 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other , goodwill is not amortized to expense, but rather that it be assessed or tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment write-downs are charged to results of operations in the period in which the impairment is determined. The Company did not identify any impairment on its outstanding goodwill from its most recent testing, which was performed as of October 1, 2013. If certain events occur which might indicate goodwill has been impaired, the goodwill is tested for impairment when such events occur. Other acquired intangible assets with finite lives, such as customer lists, are required to be amortized over the estimated lives. These intangibles are generally amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of five years. The Company tests the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment at least once a year and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates the asset may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized if the amount of the asset s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset s fair value less selling expenses or its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows (cash generating units). The Company is adopting ASU update number 2012-02 Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment whereby the Company will first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more than likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then we are not required to take further action. If the Company concludes otherwise, then we will determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the required quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount. The Company did not record an impairment loss on goodwill for 2013 and recorded an impairment loss of $405,858 for year ended December 31, 2012 that was included in operating expenses and resulting net operating loss. F-7 K. Research and Development Expenses Under ASC Topic 730 Research and Development , costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R D efforts, as well as costs incurred in connection with certain licensing arrangements. Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments made by us to third parties under licensing arrangements as expense. Upfront payments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives regulatory approval, any milestone payments will be recorded as Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, amortization of the payments will be on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter. L. Income Taxes Under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes , the Company in required to account for its income taxes through the establishment of a deferred tax asset or liability for the recognition of future deductible or taxable amounts and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax expense or benefit is recognized as a result of timing differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes during the year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss, and tax credit carry forwards. A valuation allowance is established to reduce that deferred tax asset if it is "more likely than not" that the related tax benefits will not be realized. Unfiled Federal Tax Returns In February 2009, the Company filed appropriate federal tax returns for the years ending December 31, 2003 through 2007 and may be subject to failure to file penalties. For the years ending December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2013, the Company has not filed any federal tax returns. The Company estimates that the amount of penalties, if any, will not have a material effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position. No provisions have been made in the financial statements for such penalties, if any. The Company is working with its accountants to prepare and file overdue federal tax returns for 2008 through 2013, which are anticipated to be completed and filed by the end of fiscal 2014. M. Marketable Securities Under ASC Topic 210; Regulation S-X Marketable Securities , the Company is required to measure all marketable securities at their carrying value while recognizing unrealized gains and losses as of the reporting date. N. Stock-Based Compensation Under ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , the Company is required to measure all employee share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in the statements of operations. The Company has adopted ASC Topic 718 (SFAS 123R) as of January 1, 2006 and recognizes stock-based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. O. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the time the educational materials or online seminars are provided and billed to the customer and collection of such fee is reasonably assured. License fees and joint-venture profit sharing when evidenced by executed agreements, and other fees are recognized when earned and collection is reasonably assured. P. Development Stage Enterprise The Company left the development stage as defined under the provisions of ASC Topic 915-10 during the year ended December 31, 2013. The Company is actively working on formulations for cannabinoid-based drug development, filing INDs, and commencing drug trials for FDA approved medicine. The Company s businesses of GGECO and CCI acquired during 2012 are continuing and the Company s other activities under license agreements with Apothecary has completed over a year of active business and development with expanding operations along with associated business of which the Company earned $76,938 in royalty license revenues in 2013 and expects increased revenues in 2014. The Company continues to work to develop its two key drugs, namely CS-TATI-1 targeting both newly diagnosed and treatment-experienced patients with drug-resistant HIV strains, as well as those intolerant of currently available therapies and CS-S/BCC-1 targeting basal and squamous cell carcinomas, along with its cannabinol (CBN) patent. In addition, the Company is working to progress licensing activity with Apothecary along with MOU activity with Prescription Vending Machines, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medbox, Inc. Q. Recent Accounting Pronouncements During the year ended December 31, 2013 and through April 21, 2014, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB. Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. R. Reclassifications For comparative purposes, certain prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with report classifications of the current year. F-8 2. GOING CONCERN The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company reported an accumulated deficit of $92,508,452 and had a stockholders deficit of $3,518,819 at December 31, 2013. In view of the matters described, there is substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern without a significant infusion of capital. At December 31, 2013, the Company had insufficient operating revenues and cash flow to meet its financial obligations. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in implementing its plans. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We anticipate that we will have to raise additional capital to fund operations over the next 12 months. To the extent that we are required to raise additional funds to acquire research and growing facilities, and to cover costs of operations, we intend to do so through additional public or private offerings of debt or equity securities. There are no commitments or arrangements for other offerings in place, no guaranties that any such financings would be forthcoming, or as to the terms of any such financings. Any future financing may involve substantial dilution to existing investors. We had been relying on our common stock to pay third parties for services which has resulted substantial dilution to existing investors. 3. MARKETABLE SECURITIES See Note 5 for transaction details on 7,500,000 common shares in the Endocan Corporation (OTC: ENDO) with a fair market value of $225,000 held by the Company at December 31, 2013. 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement , establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are described as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access at the measurement date. Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs for the asset of liability. The asset or liability s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Company s liabilities measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2013. Investment in marketable securities: Trading securities valued at the closing price of Endocan Corporation shares held by the Company at year end. Intangibles from GGECO and CCI acquisitions: Valued at replacement cost. The replacement cost is determined as the cost of replacing the asset with a modern unit of the near equivalent utility. The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. The following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Company s liabilities at fair value as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.

INCOME TAXES Deferred income taxes are reported using the liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Current year and accumulated deferred tax benefit at the effective Federal income tax rate of 34% is $18,876,106 (in addition to the pre-acquisition annual limitation carry-forward discussed in the following paragraph), and a valuation allowance has been set up for the full amount because of the unlikelihood that the accumulated deferred tax benefit will be realized in the future. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had available federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards amounting to approximately $43,000,000 and $37,000,000, respectively, that are available to offset future federal and state taxable income and that expire in various periods through 2033 for federal tax purposes and 2018 for state tax purposes. No benefit has been recorded for the loss carryforwards, and utilization in future years may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code if significant ownership changes have occurred or from future tax legislation changes. The following table sets forth the significant components of the net deferred tax assets for operations in the US as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. 2013 2012 Deferred tax assets: NOL expense (benefit) $ (14,599,039) $ (12,581,377) Less: valuation allowance 14,599,039 12,581,377 Net deferred tax assets $ - $ - A reconciliation of income tax expense at the statutory federal rate of 34% to income tax expense at the Company's effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 is as follows: 2013 2012 Income tax expense (benefit) at statutory federal rate $ (2,017,662) 34% $ (5,452,774) 34% State income taxes NOL limitation (Note 3) Increase (decrease) in valuation allowance 2,017,662 -34% 5,452,774 -34% Income tax expense (benefit) at Company's effective tax rate $ - 0% $ - 0% F-11 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE There were no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure during the relevant period. °Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2009. This evaluation was accomplished under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer / principal executive officer, and chief financial officer / principal financial officer who concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that all material information required to be filed in the annual report on Form 10-K has been made known to them. Disclosure, controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act") is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon an evaluation conducted for the year ended December 31, 2013, our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer as of December 31, 2013 and as of the date of this Report, has concluded that as of the end of the periods covered by this report, we have identified the following material weakness of our internal controls: Reliance upon independent financial reporting consultants for review of critical accounting areas and disclosures and material non-standard transactions. Lack of sufficient accounting staff which results in a lack of segregation of duties necessary for a good system of internal control. The Company has increased services and related staffing through its business and financial consulting contractor to remedy existing internal control deficiencies. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework at December 31, 2013. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective because of limited staff and a need for a full-time chief financial officer. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to the attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting We have not yet made any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 10 PART III °Item 10.
