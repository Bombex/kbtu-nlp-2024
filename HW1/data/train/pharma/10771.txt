MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Informatio n Our common stock is quoted in United States markets on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Boards ( OTC BB ), under the symbol HSTC.OB. There is no assurance that the common stock will continue to be traded on the OTC BB or that any liquidity exists for our shareholders. Market Price The following table shows the high and low per share price quotations of the Company's common stock as reported by the OTC BB for the periods presented. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commissions, and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. The OTC BB market is extremely limited and the prices quoted by brokers are not a reliable indication of the value of the common stock. The periods presented represent fiscal quarters, with the fourth quarter of each year ending on December 31. High Low Fiscal 2013 First Quarter 0.002 0.011 Second Quarter 0.002 0.011 Third Quarter 0.011 0.007 Fourth Quarter 0.025 0.007 Fiscal 2012 First Quarter 0.0022 0.0016 Second Quarter 0.0022 0.0022 Third Quarter 0.089 0.001 Fourth Quarter 0.027 0.0054 As of December 31, 2013, the Company had 100,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with 36,719,854, issued and outstanding.

Penny Stock Regulations Our common stock is quoted in United States markets on the OTC BB under the symbol HSTC.OB. The sale price of our common stock has been reported as low as $0.001 per share. As such, the Company's common stock may be subject to provisions of Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), commonly referred to as the penny stock rule. Section 15(g) sets forth certain requirements for transactions in penny stocks, and Rule 15g-9(d) incorporates the definition of penny stock that is found in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. The SEC generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. As long as the Company's common stock is deemed to be a penny stock, trading in the shares will be subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Dividends The Company has not issued any dividends on the common stock to date, and does not intend to issue any dividends on the common stock in the near future. We currently intend to use all profits to further the growth and development of the Company.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION Forward-Looking Statements Statements about our future expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable Federal Securities Laws, and are not guarantees of future performance. When used herein, the words may, will, should, anticipate, believe, appear, intend, plan, expect, estimate, approximate, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, including those set forth in Item 1A under the caption Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and other filings with the SEC, and are subject to change at any time. Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement. Overview HST Global, Inc. is an Integrated Health and Wellness Biotechnology company that is developing and /or acquiring a network of Wellness Centers worldwide that are primarily focused on the homeopathic and alternative treatment of late stage cancer. In addition, the company intends to acquire innovative products for the treatment of individual health challenges. In this regard, the company primarily focuses on homeopathic and alternative product candidates that are undergoing or have already completed significant clinical testing. The company has identified the growing acceptance of alternative treatments worldwide which has placed us in a perfect position to open our own brand of Treatment Centers. This strategy will enable the company to address the challenges individuals face in the treatment challenging and in some cases life threatening diseases. Plan of Operation General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, professional fees, business insurance, rent, general legal activities, and other corporate expenses. We have never been profitable and do not anticipate having net income unless and until we develop and/or acquire our wellness centers and/or develop new channels of distribution. With respect to our current activities, this is not likely to occur until we obtain significant additional funding. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able Page 6 to achieve profitability on a sustained basis, if at all, obtain the required funding, obtain, or complete additional corporate partnering or acquisition transactions. Accordingly, we will need to raise additional funds or pursue strategic transactions or other strategic alternatives. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of our equity securities, and we expect to continue obtaining required capital in a similar manner. Results of Operations The Company had no revenues and no cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. The Company incurred expenses of $157,348 for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $342,155 in 2012. The decrease in expenses in 2013 was primarily a result of a reduction in compensation paid to consultants and general and administrative expenses. We do not believe these costs are indicative of future years, and we cannot at this time predict our costs if and when we begin earning revenues and exit the development stage. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital requirements are principally related to our efforts to implement our business plan. Our cash balance as of December 31, 2013 was $230. The Company does not currently have sufficient capital in its accounts, nor sufficient firm commitments for capital to assure its ability to meet its current obligations or to continue its planned operations. The Company is continuing to pursue working capital and additional revenue through the seeking of the capital it needs to carry on its planned operations. There is no assurance that any of the planned activities will be successful. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements None. °Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK None. °Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Description Page Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm F-8 Consolidated Balance Sheets F-9 Consolidated Statements of Operations F-10 Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders Interest F-11 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows F-12 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements F-13 Page 7 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors HST Global, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of HST Global, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficiency and cash flows for the years then ended and for the cumulative period from August 6, 2007 (date of inception) through December 31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of HST Global, Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the years then ended and for the cumulative period from August 6, 2007 (date of inception) through December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company had accumulated losses of $4,895,540 for the period from inception through December 31, 2013 which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Sadler, Gibb Associates, LLC Salt Lake City, UT April 3, 2014 801.783.2950 office 801.783.2960 fax www.sadlergibb.com | 2455 East Parleys Way Suite 320, Salt Lake City, UT 84109 F-8 HST Global, Inc.

The Company has made several acquisitions and disposals of various business entities and activities. On May 9, 2008, the Company entered into a Merger and share exchange agreement with Health Source Technologies, Inc. This business acquisition has been accounted for as a reverse merger or recapitalization of Health Source Technologies, Inc. At the time of the merger NT Holding Corporation had disposed of its assets and liabilities and had minimal operations and was considered a development stage company. Immediately after the acquisition the Company changed its name to HST Global, Inc. Health Source Technologies, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 6, 2007. The Company is currently headquartered in Hampton, Virginia. HST Global, Inc. is an integrated Health and Wellness Biotechnology company that is developing and/or acquiring a network of Wellness Centers worldwide with the primary focus on homeopathic and alternative treatments of late stage cancer and other life threatening diseases. In addition, the Company intends to acquire innovative products for the treatment of life threatening diseases. The Company primarily focuses on homeopathic and alternative product candidates that are undergoing or have already completed significant clinical testing for the treatment of late stage cancer and/or life threatening diseases. NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements and related notes include the activity of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to Form 10-K. Development Stage Company Classification The Company is considered to be in the development stage as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 915. This standard requires companies to report their operations, shareholders equity and cash flows from inception through the reporting date. The Company will continue to be reported as a development stage entity until, among other factors, revenues are generated from management s intended operations. Management has provided financial data since inception (August 6, 2007). Accounting Method The Company s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected an December 31 year-end. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents F-12 HST Global, Inc. (a Development Stage Company) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 We maintain cash balances in non-interest-bearing accounts, which do not currently exceed federally insured limits. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes , which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company applies the provisions of ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . The ASC clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. The ASC prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The ASC provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company did not identify any material uncertain tax positions on returns that have been filed or that will be filed. The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, nor were any interest or penalties accrued as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share The computations of basic loss per share of common stock are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the date of the financial statements. The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing Diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is antidilutive. The Company had no common stock equivalents outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. Stock-Based Compensation The Company adopted ASC 718, Stock Compensation , upon inception at August 6, 2007. Under ASC 718, all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. As of December 31, 2013, the Company has not issued any employer stock options. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company adopted ASC 820 which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under this standard certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and disclosures are required for items measured at fair value. The Company currently does not have non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows: F-13 HST Global, Inc. (a Development Stage Company) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. The fair value of the Company s cash is based on quoted prices and therefore classified as Level 1. Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs). Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our consolidated financial statements. The Company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. NOTE 3 GOING CONCERN The Company s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. Management s plan to support the Company in its operations and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation. If the Company does not raise all of the money it needs from public offerings, it will have to find alternative sources, such as a second public offering, a private placement of securities, or loans from its officers, directors or others. If the Company requires additional cash and is unable to raise it, it will either have to suspend operations until the cash is raised, or cease business entirely. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

No net provision for refundable Federal income tax has been made in the accompanying statement of loss because no recoverable taxes were paid previously. F-16 HST Global, Inc. (a Development Stage Company) NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 Similarly, no deferred tax asset attributable to the net operating loss carry-forward has been recognized, as it is not deemed likely to be realized. The cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 34 percent of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows: December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Income tax benefit attributable to: Net operating loss $ (65,530) $ (127,814) Common stock issued for services - - Change in valuation allowance 65,530 127,814 Net refundable amount $ - $ - The cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 34 percent of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows: December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Deferred tax asset attributable to: Net operating loss carry forwards $ (1,699,118) $ (1,633,588) Common stock issued for services 184,072 184,072 Valuation allowance 1,515,045 1,449,516 Net deferred tax asset $ - $ - The Company s zero percent effective tax rate for each year, as compared to the 34 percent statutory rate, results from non-deductible stock based compensation and the change in valuation allowance.

NOTE 9 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In accordance with ASC 855, Company management reviewed all material events through the date of this report and determined that there are no material subsequent events to report. F-17 °Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES None. °Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Our management, including our Principal Executive and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2013. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2013. (b) Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-a5(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use of disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2013 and there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses relate to the limited number of persons responsible for the recording and reporting of financial information, the lack of separation of financial reporting duties, and the limited size of our management team in general. We are in the process evaluating methods of improving our internal control over financial reporting, including the possible addition of financial reporting staff and the increased separation of financial reporting responsibility, and intend to implement such steps as are necessary and possible to correct these material weaknesses. Page 18 (c) Change in Internal Controls There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2013, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. °Item 9B.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Compensation Discussion and Analysis We do not have a standing compensation committee. Our board of directors as a whole makes the decisions as to employee benefit programs and officer and employee compensation. The primary objectives of our executive compensation programs are to: attract, retain and motivate skilled and knowledgeable individuals; ensure that compensation is aligned with our corporate strategies and business objectives; promote the achievement of key strategic and financial performance measures by linking short-term and long-term cash and equity incentives to the achievement of measurable corporate and individual performance goals; and align executives' incentives with the creation of stockholder value. To achieve these objectives, our board of directors evaluates our executive compensation program with the objective of setting compensation at levels they believe will allow us to attract and retain qualified executives. In addition, a portion of each executive's overall compensation is tied to key strategic, financial and operational goals set by our board of directors. We also generally provide a portion of our executive compensation in the form of options that vest over time, which we believe helps us retain our executives and align their interests with those of our stockholders by allowing the executives to participate in our longer term success as reflected in asset growth and stock price appreciation. Page 20 Named Executive Officers The following table identifies our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer and our most highly paid executive officers, who, for purposes of this Compensation Disclosure and Analysis only, are referred to herein as the named executive officers. Name Corporate Office Ron Howell Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer Components of our Executive Compensation Program At this time, Named Executive Officers receives compensation for their services to the Company. Compensation will be negotiated in the near future and may be contingent on the availability of financing. The primary elements of our executive compensation program will be base salaries and option grant incentive awards, although the board of directors has the authority to award cash bonuses, benefits and other forms of compensation as it sees fit. The Company has entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Howell whereby the Company agreed to pay Mr. Howell $10,000 per month for consulting services thru December 31, 2013. The consulting agreement may be terminated at will by the Company. The Company intends to continue to engage Mr. Howell as a consultant until his consulting services are no longer required. We do not have any formal or informal policy or target for allocating compensation between short-term and long-term compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation or among the different forms of non-cash compensation. Instead, we have determined subjectively on a case-by-case basis the appropriate level and mix of the various compensation components. Similarly, we do not rely on benchmarking against our competitors in making compensation related decisions. Base salaries Base salaries will be used to recognize the experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities required of our named executive officers. Base salary, and other components of compensation, may be evaluated by our board of directors for adjustment based on an assessment of the individual's performance and compensation trends in our industry. Equity Awards Our stock option award program will be the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our executives. To date, we have not issued any equity awards. We intend our equity awards to executives to generally be made in the form of warrants. We believe that equity grants in the form of warrants provide our executives with a direct link to our long-term performance, create an ownership culture, and align the interests of our executives and our stockholders. Cash bonuses Our board of directors has the discretion to award cash bonuses based on our financial performance and individual objectives. The corporate financial performance measures (revenues and profits) will be given the greatest weight in this bonus analysis. We have not yet granted any cash bonuses to any named executive officer nor have we yet developed any specific individual objectives while we wait to attain revenue and profitability levels sufficient to undertake any such bonuses.
