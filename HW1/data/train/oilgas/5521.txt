Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules 20 SIGNATURES 21 Table of Contents PART I References in this document to "us," "we," the "Registrant," or the "Company" refer to Avalon Oil Gas, Inc., and its predecessors. Statements contained in this Form 10-K discuss future expectations and plans which are considered forward-looking statements as defined by Section 27 (a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sentences which incorporate words such as "believes," "intends," expects," "predicts," "may," "will," "should," "contemplates," "anticipates," or similar statements are based on our beliefs and expectations using the most current information available to us. In view of the fact that our discussions in the Form 10-K are based on upon estimates and beliefs concerning circumstances and events which have not yet occurred, the anticipated results are subject to changes and variations as future operations and events actually occur and could differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Moreover, although we reasonably expect, to the best of our knowledge and belief, that the results to be achieved by us will be as set forth in the following discussion, the following discussion is not a guarantee and there can be no assurance that any of the potential results which are described will occur. Furthermore, there will usually be differences between the forecasted and actual results because events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, and the difference may be material. °Item 1. BUSINESS Business Development Avalon Oil Gas, Inc. (the "Company") was originally incorporated in Colorado in April 1991 under the name Snow Runner (USA), Inc. The Company was the general partner of Snow Runner (USA) Ltd.; a Colorado limited partnership to sell proprietary snow skates under the name "Sled Dogs" which was dissolved in August 1992. In late 1993, the Company relocated its operations to Minnesota and in January 1994 changed our name to Snow Runner, Inc. In November 1994 we changed our name to the Sled Dogs Company. On November 5, 1997, we filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In September 1998, we emerged from protection of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In May, 1999, we changed our state of domicile to Nevada and our name to XDOGS.COM, Inc. On July 22, 2005, the Board of Directors and a majority of the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to change the Company's name to Avalon Oil Gas, Inc., and to increase the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 200,000,000 shares to 1,000,000,000 shares par value of $0.001, and engage in the acquisition of producing oil and gas properties. On November 16, 2011, a majority of the Company's shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of our common stock from 1,000,000,000 shares to 3,000,000,000 shares par value of $0.001. This amendment was not filed with the Nevada Secretary of State. On June 4, 2012 the Board of Directors approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to a reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation ( Shares ) such that each holder of Shares as of the record date of June 4, 2012 shall receive one (1) post-split Share on the effective date of June 4, 2012 for each three hundred (300) Shares owned. The reverse split was effective on July 23, 2012. On September 28, 2012, we held a special meeting of Avalon s shareholders and approved an amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation such that the Company would be authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock. We filed an amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State on April 10, 2013, to increase our authorized shares to 200,000,000. Acquisition Strategy Our strategy is to acquire oil and gas producing properties that have proven reserves and established in-field drilling locations with a combination of cash, debt, and equity. We believe that acquisition of such properties minimizes our risk, allows us to generate immediate cash flow, and provides in-field drilling locations to expand production within the proven oil and gas fields. We will aggressively develop these low cost/low risk properties in order to enhance shareholder value. In addition, Avalon's technology group acquires oil production enhancing technologies. 3 Table of Contents In furtherance of the foregoing strategy, we have engaged in the following transactions during the last three years: During the year ended March 31, 2011, the Company sold working interests in wells located in Blackmon - Hall Unit, New Diana Field, Upshur County, Texas (the New Diana Wells ), of which it had previously acquired a ten percent (10%) working interest in April, 2008, for a note receivable in the amount of $42,857. These properties had a net book value at the time of the sale of $20,379. This resulted in a gain from the sale of the working interest in the wells in the amount of $22,478. The Company reached an agreement to increased our ownership in the Grace Field, Lincoln County, Oklahoma. We purchased a 13.50% working interest in the Grace # 1, a 22.50% working interest in the Grace # 2, a 14.50% working interest in the Grace # 3 and an 11.50% working interest in the Grace # 5A, and a 21.50% working interest in the Grace #6, for $43,837.50, from 17 working interest owners during the three months ending September 30, 2010. We closed this acquisition in January 2011. We also purchased a 5.75% working interest in the Grace # 1, a 6.25% working interest in the Grace # 2, an 8.5% working interest in the Grace# 3, a 4.50% working interest in the Grace# 5A and a 3.50% working interest in the Grace# 6, during the year ended March 31, 2011 by issuing 294,000 shares of common stock to two (2) working interest owners. During the year ended March 31, 2011, we advanced $160,000 for the purchase of oil and gas producing properties in Western Oklahoma, pending the completion of due diligence by the Company, if the Seller is not able to deliver clear title to these properties on or before September 30, 2013, these funds will be returned to us. We plan to raise additional capital during the coming fiscal year, but currently have not identified additional funding sources. Our ability to continue operations is highly dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing, or generate revenues from our acquired oil and gas leasehold interests, none of which can be guaranteed. Ultimately, our success is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues from our acquired oil and gas leasehold interests, and to achieve profitability, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including general economic conditions and the sustained profitability resulting from the operation of the acquired oil and gas leaseholds. There is no assurance that even with adequate financing or combined operations, we will generate revenues and be profitable. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS On May 17, 2006, The Company signed a strategic alliance agreement with Innovaro Corporation, a technology transfer company to develop a portfolio of new technologies for the oil and gas industry. 4 Table of Contents On November 9, 2006, The Company acquired Intelli-Well Technologies, Inc., ("IWT"). IWT holds a license for borehole casing technology developed by researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. On March 29, 2007, The Company acquired Leak Location Technologies, Inc., ("LLT"). LLT owns an exclusive license to a system for determining the presence and location of leaks in underground pipes. On May 17, 2007, The Company renewed its strategic alliance agreement with Innovaro Corporation, a technology transfer company to develop a portfolio of new technologies for the oil and gas industry. On August 16, 2007, Kent Rodriguez, the Company's President and CEO, presented a proposal to the Board of Directors to spin-off Oiltek Inc. ("Oiltek"), which specializes in oil and gas recovery technology to Avalon's shareholders. The oil and gas technology include, but are not limited, to the Patent; a system to detect hazardous gas leaks including small leaks in natural gas pipelines; and a system for intelligent drilling and completion sensors to provide real-time oil reservoir monitoring of subsurface information. On September 22, 2007 the Company entered into an agreement with respect to its purchase of a 75.6% interest in Oiltek for $50,000 and the right of Oiltek to promote Avalon's intellectual property. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS During the last three fiscal years, compliance with environmental laws and regulations did not have a specific impact on the Company's operations. The Company does not anticipate that it will incur any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during the next fiscal year. EMPLOYEES As of March 31, 2013 we had two full time employees, our President, Kent Rodriguez and an administrative assistant. The Board retains consultants and advisors on as needed basis. They are compensated with cash and also with the issuance of the Company s common stock. We also have three part time employees at this time. 5 Table of Contents RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT During the last three fiscal years, we did not incur research and development expenses. °Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Any investment in our securities is highly speculative. The Company's business and ownership of shares of our common stock are subject to numerous risks. You should not purchase our shares if you cannot afford to lose your entire investment. You should consider the following risks before acquiring any of our shares. We have never been, and may never be, profitable. During the past several years, we have attempted, without success, to generate revenues and profits. For the year ended March 31, 2013, we incurred a net loss of $749,314. There can be no assurance that we will ever be profitable. We need additional capital. We need additional financing to continue operations. The amount required depends upon our business operations, and the capital needs of our acquisition of the certain oil and gas leasehold interests. We may be unable to secure this additional required financing on a timely basis, under terms acceptable to us, or at all. To obtain additional financing, we will likely sell additional equity securities, which will further dilute shareholders' ownership in us. Ultimately, if we do not raise the required capital, we may need to cease operations. We are dependent upon our key personnel. We are highly dependent upon the services of Kent A. Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer. If he terminated his services with us, our business would suffer. There is only a limited trading market for our securities. Our Common Stock is traded on the OTCQB and OCTBB. The prices quoted may not reflect the price at which you can resell your shares. Because of the low price of our stock, we are subject to particular rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that make it difficult for stock brokers to solicit customers to purchase our stock. This reduces the number of potential buyers of our stock and may reduce the value of your shares. There can be no assurance that a trading market for our stock will continue or that you will ever be able to resell your shares at a profit, or at all. 6 Table of Contents Our management controls us. Our current officers and directors own approximately 42% of our outstanding stock and are able to affect the election of the members of our Board of Directors and make corporate decisions. Mr. Rodriguez, by his ownership of Class A Preferred Stock, has the right to vote 40% of our voting securities. Accordingly, even if we issue additional shares to third parties, Mr. Rodriguez will continue to control at least 40% of our voting securities. This voting concentration may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or control or otherwise discourage potential acquirers from attempting to gain control of us. If potential acquirers are deterred, you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition. See "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters" and "Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters". A significant number of shares are eligible for public sale, potentially depressing our stock price. Under the SEC's Rule 144, shares issued in issuances which are not registered with the SEC generally first become eligible for public resale after six months. Shareholders who are affiliates of us generally may resell only a limited number of their privately acquired shares after six months. After six months, stockholders who are not affiliated with us may resell any number of their privately acquired shares pursuant to Rule 144. The resale of the shares we have privately issued, or the potential for their future public resale, may depress our stock price. Our governing documents and Nevada law may discourage the potential acquisitions of our business. Our Board of Directors may issue additional shares of capital stock and establish their rights, preferences and classes, in most cases without stockholder approval. In addition, we may become subject to anti-takeover provisions found in Section 89.378-78.379 of the Nevada Business Corporation Act which may deter changes in control of our management which have not been approved by our Board of Directors. °Item 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate office is located at 310 Fourth Avenue South, Suite 7000, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55415. This office space is leased from an unaffiliated third party on a month to month lease, for a monthly rental of $1,000. On July 2, 2008, we signed a letter agreement to acquire all of the oil and gas producing assets owned by Bedford Energy, Inc. in the East Chandler Field, Lincoln County, Oklahoma. We increased our current interest in the Grace #2 well and acquired working interests in four other producing wells in the East Chandler Field, the Grace #1, Grace #3, Grace #5A and Grace #6 wells. We increased our working interest in the Grace #2 from 2.5% to 7.5%; and increasing our net revenue interest in the Grace #2 to 11.95%. We initially acquired our working interest in the Grace #2 well in June, 2008. We also acquired acquiring a 10% working interest and 13.825% net revenue interest in the Grace #1, Grace #3, Grace #5A and Grace #6 wells and a 50% working interest in a salt water disposal well and offset and development acreage in the two quarter sections (320 acres) adjoining the Grace Wells in the East Chandler Field. The table below shows the Company s working interests in the Grace Wells: Well March 31, 2013 and 2012 Working Interest Grace #1 65.25 % Grace #2 55.75 % Grace #3 64.00 % Grace #5A 52.00 % Grace #6 58.00 % 7 Table of Contents We expect to increase our ownership in the Grace wells. As of March 31, 2013, the working interest owners owe the Company $160,226. We will file a claim against these working interest owners and foreclose on this claim to increase our ownership. °Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is not a party to any legal proceedings that would have a material effect on the Company s operations. °Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES (Not applicable) PART II °Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES (a) Principal Market or Markets Effective with the close of business on June 19, 1997, our Common Stock was delisted from the NASDAQ Small Cap Market. In June of 1997, our Common Stock began trading on the NASD Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board ("OTCBB"). Since April 2010 our Common Stock has traded and continues to trade on the electronic OTCQB and OTCBB market. Market makers and other dealers provided bid and ask quotations of our Common Stock. We trade under the symbol "AOGN". The table below represents the range of high and low bid quotations of our Common Stock as reported during the reporting period herein. The following bid price market quotations represent prices between dealers and do not include retail markup, markdown, or commissions; hence, they may not represent actual transactions. Per Share Common Stock Bid Prices by Quarter For the Two Most Recent Fiscal Years High Low Quarter Ended March 31, 2013 $ 0.19 $ 0.09 Quarter Ended December 31, 2012 $ 0.25 $ 0.09 Quarter Ended September 30, 2012 $ 0.10 $ 005 Quarter Ended June 30, 2012 $ 0.12 $ 0.05 Quarter Ended March 31, 2012 $ 0.87 $ 0.12 Quarter Ended December 31, 2011 $ 1.95 $ 1.05 Quarter Ended September 30, 2011 $ 2.70 $ 1.95 Quarter Ended June 30, 2011 $ 0.39 $ 0.195 As of August 7, 2013, 10,208,062 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding and the number of holders of record of our Common Stock at that date was approximately 686. However, we estimate that there are a significantly greater number of shareholders because a substantial number of our shares are held in nominee names by brokerage firms. (b) Dividends No dividends on the Common Stock were paid by us during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, or the fiscal year ended 2012, nor do we anticipate paying dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors. 8 Table of Contents (c) Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans. We have not established an Equity Compensation Plan and have not authorized the issuance of any securities under such plan. (d) Preferred Stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of $0.10 par value preferred stock, with such classes, series and preferences as our Board of Directors may determine from time to time. In June 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the issuance of 100 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock"). Our Board further agreed to issue all of the Series A Preferred Stock to our Chairman and President, Kent Rodriguez, in satisfaction of $500,000 in loans made by Mr. Rodriguez The Series A Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 8% per annum on the original purchase price for the shares. If declared by the Board of Directors, these dividends are payable quarterly, beginning in September 2002. We are prohibited from paying any dividends on our Common Stock until all accrued dividends are paid on our Series A Preferred Stock. If we liquidate or dissolve, and after payment of our debts, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a preference payment before we make any distributions to our Common Stockholders. The preference amount is equal to the original purchase price for the Series A Preferred shares plus accrued, but unpaid dividends. The Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at anytime into 40% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock and securities convertible into Common Stock on a fully diluted basis. However, conversion is limited to the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under our articles of incorporation. Regardless of whether or not the Series A Preferred Stock has been converted to our Common Stock, the Series A Preferred Stockholder is entitled to vote, at all times, on an as-if converted basis. The Preferred Stockholder, Mr. Rodriguez, has the right to vote the Series A Preferred Stock together with his other holdings in the Company. In March, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the issuance of 2,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the "Series B Preferred Stock") The face amount of share of the Series B Preferred Stock is $1,000. The Series B Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 8% per annum on the original purchase price for the shares. If declared by the Board of Directors, these dividends are payable annually, beginning in January 2014. We are prohibited from paying any dividends on our Common Stock until all accrued dividends are paid on our Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Stock owned by our President and Chief Exeutive Officer, as to Dividends and to a distribution of assets in the event of a liquidation of assets. The Holders of Series B Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights and their consent is not required to take any sort of corporate action.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Not applicable. °Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PLAN OF OPERATION The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes related thereto. The discussion of results, causes and trends should not be construed to infer conclusions that such results, causes or trends necessarily will continue in the future. For the year ended March 31, 2013 compared to the year ended March 31, 2012 Revenues Revenues for the year ended March 31, 2013 were $163,574, a decrease of $90,308 or approximately 36% compared to revenue of $253,882 for the year ended March 31, 2012. Revenue from the sale of oil and gas decreased as a result of the decrease in gas production from the wells in the Grace Field, a decrease in oil production from the wells in Miller County, Arkansas, and a decrease in the market price of natural gas. Lease Operating Expenses During the year ending March 31, 2013, our lease operating expenses were $124,902, a decrease of $3,969 or approximately 3% compared to $128,871 for the year ended March 31, 2012. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2013 were $339,502 a decrease of $153,336 or approximately 31% compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $492,838 during the year ended March 31, 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2013 consisted primarily of payroll and related costs of $66,464; legal and accounting fees in the amount of $46,444; facilities costs in the amount of 34,701; investor relations costs of $12,425; travel and entertainment expenses of $21,757; office expenses of $14,285 and consulting fees in the amount of $17,496. . The decrease was due to lower facilities expense, office rent decreased from $3,600 per month to $1,000 per month and a reduction in consulting expense Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation for the year ended March 31, 2013 was $197,500, an increase of $151,554 or approximately 320% compared to non-cash compensation of $45,946 for the year ended March 31, 2012. This increase was the result of more common stock issuances to outside consultants as payment for services rendered. 10 Table of Contents Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization were $76,133 for the year ended March 31, 2013 an increase of $6,154 or approximately 9% compared to $69,979 for the year ended March 31, 2012, due to a slight increase in the depletion allowance. Gain on Sale of Property During the year ended March 31, 2013, the Company did not sell any oil and gas properties. Loss on Settlement of Debt During the year ended March 31, 2013, the Company had a net loss on the settlement of debt in the amount of $48,711. Interest Expense, net of Interest Income Interest expense, net of interest income of $126,140 for the year ended March 31, 2013, a decrease of $163,621 or approximately 56% compared to interest expense, net of $289,761 for the year ended March 31, 2012. This decrease is due to a decrease in the amortization of the discount on the promissory notes issued by the Company. Net Loss For the reasons stated above, our net loss for the year ended March 31, 2013, was $749,314 an increase of $12,160 or approximately 2% compared to a net loss of $737,154 during the year ended March 31, 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources Going Concern The March 31, 2013, financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. However, the Company has incurred a loss of $29,972,830 from inception through March 31, 2013, and has a working capital deficiency of $781,776 and stockholders equity of $442,088, respectively, at March 31, 2013. The Company currently has minimal revenue generating operations and expects to incur substantial operating expenses in order to expand its business. As a result, the Company expects to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might become necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 11 Table of Contents Our cash and cash equivalents were $129,931 on March 31, 2013, compared to $114,533 on March 31, 2013. We met our liquidity needs through the issuance of our common stock, preferred stock, and convertible notes payable for cash and the revenue derived from oil and gas operations. We need to raise additional capital during the fiscal year, but currently have not acquired sufficient additional funding. Our ability to continue operations as a going concern is highly dependent upon our ability to obtain immediate additional financing, or generate revenues from our acquired oil and gas leasehold interest, and to achieve profitability, none of which can be guaranteed. Unless additional funding is located, it is highly unlikely that we can continue to operate. There is no assurance that even with adequate financing or combined operations, we will generate revenues and be profitable. Ultimately, our success is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues from our acquired oil and gas leasehold interests. Operating activities Net cash used by operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2013 was $333,833, compared to $430,338 used in the year ended March 31, 2012.

As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A summary of the significant accounting policies is described in Note 1 to the financial statements. Recently enacted accounting standards During the year, The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) has issued various pronouncements, none of which apply to the current financial statements.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our principal executive and financial officers, after evaluating the effectiveness of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of March 31, 2012, have concluded that as of March 31, 2013, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could affect these controls during or subsequent to the end of the period covered by this report. 13 Table of Contents Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures which: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013 based upon the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm with respect to internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission which permit us to provide only our management s report in this Annual Report. We believe that our internal controls are effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified during our year ended March 31, 2013, which have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. °Item 9B.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Avalon Oil Gas, Inc. (the Company ) as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company, as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1, the Company has incurred significant losses from operations since its inception and has a working capital deficiency. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ Bernstein Pinchuk llp Bernstein Pinchuk llp New York, New York August 20, 2013 F-1 Table of Contents Avalon Oil Gas, Inc.

F-7 Table of Contents AVALON OIL GAS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 AND 2011 Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and The Company s subsidiary Oiltek, Inc. All significant inter-company items have been eliminated in consolidation. Going Concern The March 31, 2013, financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. However, the Company has incurred a loss of $29,972,830 from inception through March 31, 2013, and has a working capital deficiency of $781,776 and stockholders equity of $442,088 as of March 31, 2013. The Company currently has minimal revenue generating operations and expects to incur substantial operating expenses in order to expand its business. As a result, the Company expects to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company will continue so seek equity and debt financing to meet our operating losses. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might become necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Basis of Accounting The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses when incurred. F-8 Table of Contents AVALON OIL GAS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 AND 2012 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade commercial paper that are readily convertible into cash and purchased with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at several financial institutions. Accounts at the institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company's financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable, notes receivable and long-term debt. The recorded values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair values based on their short-term nature. The recorded values of notes payable, notes receivable and long-term debt approximate their fair values, as interest approximates market rates. Accounts Receivable Management periodically assesses the collectability of the Company's accounts receivable. Accounts determined to be uncollectible are charged to operations when that determination is made. The Company had an allowance for accounts receivable of $140,227 and $135,708 for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. Oil and Natural Gas Properties The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for natural gas and oil properties. Under the full cost concept, all costs incurred in acquiring, exploring, and developing properties cost center are capitalized when incurred and are amortized as mineral reserves in the cost center are produced, subject to a limitation that the capitalized costs not exceed the value of those reserves. The unamortized costs relating to a property that is surrendered, abandoned, or otherwise disposed of are accounted for as an adjustment of accumulated amortization, rather than as a gain or loss that enters into the determination of net income, until all of the properties constituting the amortization base are disposed of, at which point gain or loss is recognized. all acquisition, exploration, and development costs are capitalized. The Company capitalizes all internal costs, including: salaries and related fringe benefits of employees directly engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties, as well as other identifiable general and administrative costs associated with such activities. During the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, no acquisition costs were capitalized. Oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for recoverability at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may exceed future undiscounted cash inflows. As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had not identified any such impairment. F-9 Table of Contents AVALON OIL GAS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 AND 2012 Other Property and Equipment Other property and equipment is reviewed on an annual basis for impairment and as of March 31, 2013, the Company had not identified any such impairment. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations when incurred and improvements and renewals are capitalized. Other property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax purposes. Their estimated useful lives are as follows: Office Equipment: 5-7 Years Asset Retirement Obligations In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standard Codification ASC 410-20-15, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations , the Company records the fair value of its liability for asset retirement obligations in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long live assets. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value at the end of each reporting period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related assets. Upon settlement of the liability, the Company will either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement. The Company's asset retirement obligations relate to the plugging and abandonment of its oil properties. Intangible Assets The cost of licensed technologies acquired is capitalized and will be amortized over the shorter of the term of the licensing agreement or the remaining life of the underlying patents. The Company evaluates recoverability of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that intangible assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to: (1) a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, (2) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or (3) an accumulation of cost significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset. The Company measures the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it. There were not any impairment losses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. Should the sum of the expected cash flows be less than the carrying amount of assets being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets, exceed fair value. Estimated amortization of intangible assets over the next five years is as follows: March 31, 2014 $ 42,585 2015 42,585 2016 42,585 2017 10,647 $ 138,402 F-10 Table of Contents AVALON OIL GAS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 AND 2012 Stock Based Compensation Share awards granted to employees and independent directors are accounted for under ASC 718, "Share-Based Payment". ASC 718-10 eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transaction using the intrinsic value method and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company has elected to adopt the provisions of ASC 718-10 effective January 1, 2006, under the modified prospective transition method, in which compensation cost was recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of ASC 718-10 for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of ASC 718-10 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of ASC 718-10 that remain unvested on the effective date. The Company records share-based compensation expense for awards granted to non-employees in exchange for services at fair value in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, " Equity based " payment to non-employees. For the awards granted to non-employees, the Company will record compensation expenses equal to the fair value of the share options at the measurement date, which is determined to be the earlier of the performance commitment date or the service completion date. Warrants The value of warrants issued is recorded at their fair values as determined by use of a Black Scholes Model at such time or over such periods as the warrants vest. Loss per Common Share ASC 260-10-45, Earnings Per Share , requires presentation of "basic" and "diluted" earnings per share on the face of the statements of operations for all entities with complex capital structures. Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted during the period. Dilutive securities having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted earnings per share are excluded from the calculation. In addition, the Company had a net loss during current period so dilutive securities would decrease negative EPS and have an anti-dilutive effect. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carry forwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. ASC 740-10-25, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , is intended to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's financial statements and prescribes the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Under ASC 740-10-25, evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. F-11 Table of Contents AVALON OIL GAS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 AND 2012 Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met. The adoption of ASC 740-10-25 at January 1, 2007 did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position. Revenue Recognition In accordance with the requirements ASC topic 605 "Revenue Recognition", revenues are recognized at such time as (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Specifically, oil and gas sales are recognized as income at such time as the oil and gas are delivered to a viable third party purchaser at an agreed price. Interest income is recognized as it is earned. Long-Lived Assets Equipment is stated at acquired cost less accumulated depreciation. Office equipment is depreciated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (five to seven years). Impairment of long-lived assets is recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or related group of assets may not be recoverable. If the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized at that time. Measurement of impairment may be based upon appraisal, market value of similar assets or discounted cash flows. There was no impairment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. F-12 Table of Contents AVALON OIL GAS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 AND 2012 NOTE 2: RECEIVABLE FROM JOINT INTERESTS The Company is the operator of certain wells acquired in the Expanded Bedford Agreement (see note 4). Pursuant to a joint interest operating agreement (the Joint Interest Agreement ), the Company charges the other owners of the Grace Wells for their pro-rata share of operating and workover expenses. These receivables are carried on the Company s balance sheet as Receivable from Joint Interests. At March 31, 2013 and 2012, the amount of these receivables is $160,227 and $155,708, respectively. During the year ended March 31, 2013, the Company deemed the collectability of the receivable from joint interests in the amount of $140,227 and 135,708 respectively as unlikely.

NOTE 8: INCOME TAXES Deferred income taxes result from the temporary difference arising from the use of accelerated depreciation methods for income tax purposes and the straight-line method for financial statement purposes, and an accumulation of Net Operating Loss carryforwards for income tax purposes with a valuation allowance against the carryforwards for book purposes. F-21 Table of Contents AVALON OIL GAS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 AND 2012 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in deferred tax assets are Federal and State net operating loss carryforwards of $29,972,830, which will expire beginning in 2028. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon our cumulative losses through March 31, 2013, we have provided a valuation allowance reducing the net realizable benefits of these deductible differences to $0 at March 31, 2013. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could change in the near term if projected future taxable income is realized. Due to significant changes in the Company's ownership, the Company's future use of its existing net operating losses may be limited. A reconciliation between the actual income tax expense and income taxes computed by applying the statutory Federal and state income tax rates to income from continuing operations before income taxes is as follows: Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2013 Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2012 Computed expected income tax expense at approximately 34% $ (254,767 ) $ (238,000 ) Change in valuation allowance (254,767 ) (238,000 ) $ - $ - NOTE 9: STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Preferred Stock The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share.

The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have the right to convert the preferred stock into shares of common stock such that if converted simultaneously, they shall represent 40 percent (40%) of the fully diluted shares outstanding after their issuance.

F-26 Table of Contents AVALON OIL GAS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 AND 2012 Natural Gas and Oil Reserve Quantities The following schedule contains estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves attributable to the Company. Proved reserves are estimated quantities of natural gas and oil that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are those which are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Reserves are stated in thousand cubic feet (mcf) of natural gas and barrels (bbl) of oil. Geological and engineering estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves at one point in time are highly interpretive, inherently imprecise and subject to ongoing revisions that may be substantial in amount. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reserve estimates are accurate, due to their nature reserve estimates are generally less precise than other estimates presented in connection with financial statement disclosures.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2013 AND 2012 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows The following schedule presents the standardized measure of estimated discounted future net cash flows from the Company's proved reserves for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. Estimated future cash flows are based on independent reserve data. Because the standardized measure of future net cash flows was prepared using the prevailing economic conditions existing at March 31, 2013 and 2012, it should be emphasized that such conditions continually change. Accordingly, such information should not serve as a basis in making any judgment on the potential value of the Company's recoverable reserves or in estimating future results of operations.

The weighted average gas wellhead price used in computing the Company's reserves were $2.97 and $3.83/mmbtu at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The oil and gas pricing were calculated using the arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month that was received for each property during the previous fiscal year. These prices were held constant throughout the economic life of the properties. Previous year run checks were used to determine the actual prices received. The following schedule contains a comparison of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to the net carrying value of proved natural gas and oil properties at March 31, 2013 and 2012: March 31, 2013 March 31, 2012 Standardized measure of discount future net cash flows $ 288,401 $ 323,496 Proved natural oil and gas property, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization, including impairment 186,167 208,281 Standardized measure of discount future net cash flows in excess of net carrying value of proved natural oil and gas properties $ 102,234 $ 115,215 F-28 Table of Contents AVALON OIL GAS, INC.
