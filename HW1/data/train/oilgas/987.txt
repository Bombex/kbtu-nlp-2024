We are a limited partner of Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P., which we refer to as the Partnership. This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements, which are statements that frequently use words such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, may, plan, position, projection, should, strategy, target, will and similar words. Although we believe that such forward-looking statements are reasonable based on currently available information, such statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of performance. Future actions, conditions or events and future results of operations may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Our results of operations, financial position and cash flows are dependent on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Partnership . Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond the Partnership s ability to control or predict. Specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include: (1) changes in the demand for or the supply of, forecast data for, and price trends related to crude oil, liquid petroleum, natural gas and NGLs, including the rate of development of the Alberta Oil Sands; (2) our ability to successfully complete and finance expansion projects; (3) the effects of competition, in particular, by other pipeline systems; (4) shut-downs or cutbacks at our facilities or refineries, petrochemical plants, utilities or other businesses for which we transport products or to whom we sell products; (5) hazards and operating risks that may not be covered fully by insurance, including those related to Lines 6A and 6B; (6) changes in or challenges to our tariff rates; and (7) changes in laws or regulations to which we are subject, including compliance with environmental and operational safety regulations that may increase costs of system integrity testing and maintenance. For additional factors that may affect results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which are available to the public over the Internet at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC s, website ( www.sec.gov ) and at our website (www.enbridgemanagement.com).

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, which we refer to as the Partnership s 10-K, for a discussion of risks to the Partnership that also may affect us. i Table of Contents PART I °Item 1. Business OVERVIEW In this report, unless the context requires otherwise, references to we, us, our, the Company, or Enbridge Management are intended to mean Enbridge Energy Management, L.L.C. Our shares, representing limited liability company interests, which we refer to as our Listed Shares, are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol EEQ. References to our shares in this Annual Report mean, collectively, our Listed Shares and our voting shares. We are a publicly-traded Delaware limited liability company that was formed on May 14, 2002. We are a limited partner of the Partnership through our ownership of i-units, a special class of the Partnership s limited partner interests. The Partnership s Class A common units are traded on the NYSE under the symbol EEP, which, together with the Class B common units, we refer to as common units. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows depend on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Partnership. Under a delegation of control agreement among us, the Partnership and its general partner, Enbridge Energy Company, Inc., referred to as the General Partner, we manage the Partnership s business and affairs. The General Partner is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Enbridge Inc., an energy company based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada that we refer to herein as Enbridge. As of both December 31, 2012 and 2011, we owned an approximate 13.3% limited partnership interest of the Partnership. At December 31, 2012, the General Partner owned 4.48 of our voting shares, which represents 100% of our voting shares as well as 6,936,939 of our Listed Shares, which represents 16.8% of our Listed Shares, while the remaining 34,261,481 of our Listed Shares were held by the public, which represents 83.2% of our Listed Shares. Our performance depends on the operations and management of the Partnership. Accordingly, we incorporate by reference the Partnership s 10-K. On October 17, 2002, we became a limited partner of the Partnership and, pursuant to a delegation of control agreement, assumed the management of the Partnership s business and affairs. The delegation of control agreement provides that we will not amend or propose to amend the Partnership s partnership agreement, allow a merger or consolidation involving the Partnership, allow a sale or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership or dissolve or liquidate the Partnership without the approval of the General Partner. The General Partner remains responsible to the Partnership for actions taken or omitted by us while serving as the delegate of the General Partner as if the General Partner had taken or omitted to take such actions. The General Partner owns all of our voting shares. The General Partner has agreed not to voluntarily withdraw as general partner of the Partnership and has agreed not to transfer its interest as general partner of the Partnership unless the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of the delegation of control agreement that apply to the General Partner. Under its partnership agreement, except for the available cash that the Partnership is required to retain in respect of the i-units, the Partnership distributes all of its available cash to the General Partner and holders of its common units on a quarterly basis. The amount of cash distributed by the Partnership depends on the operations of the Partnership and its subsidiaries and is determined by our board of directors in accordance with the Partnership s partnership agreement. We do not, however, receive distributions of cash in respect of the i-units we own and do not otherwise have any cash flow attributable to our ownership of the i-units. Instead, when the Partnership makes distributions of cash to the General Partner and holders of its common units, the number of i-units we own increases automatically under the Partnership s partnership agreement and the amount of available cash that is attributable to the i-units is retained by the Partnership. The amount of this increase is calculated by dividing the amount of the cash distribution paid by the Partnership on each of its common units by the average 1 Table of Contents closing price of one of our Listed Shares on the NYSE as determined for a 10 trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date for our shares. Concurrently with the increase in the number of i-units we own, we make distributions on our shares in the form of additional shares, with the result that the number of shares that are then outstanding equal the number of i-units that we own. We have elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, an owner of our shares does not report on its U.S. federal income tax return any of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction relating to an investment in us. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income; however, the i-units owned by us generally are not entitled to allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction of the Partnership unless there is a liquidation of the Partnership. Therefore, we do not anticipate that we will have material amounts of taxable income resulting from our ownership of the i-units unless we enter into a sale or exchange of the i-units or the Partnership is liquidated. The Partnership recognizes the delegation of rights and powers to us, and indemnifies and protects us, our officers and our directors to the same extent as it does with respect to the General Partner under the Partnership s partnership agreement. In addition, the Partnership reimburses us for expenses to the same extent as it does with respect to the General Partner under the Partnership s partnership agreement and reimburses us for any Texas franchise taxes and any other foreign, state and local taxes not otherwise paid or reimbursed pursuant to a tax indemnification agreement between Enbridge and us. The delegation of control agreement with the General Partner continues until: Either the General Partner has withdrawn (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) or has been removed as the general partner of the Partnership; All of our shares are owned by the General Partner of the Partnership or its affiliates, and termination of the delegation of control agreement has been approved by us and the General Partner of the Partnership; or Termination of the delegation of control agreement has been approved by us, the General Partner, the record holders of a majority of the outstanding Listed Shares (other than the General Partner, the record holder of the voting shares or their respective affiliates) and the record holders of the majority of the voting shares. The General Partner is the only general partner of the Partnership. The General Partner retains its general partner interest and shares in the profits, losses and distributions from the Partnership. If the General Partner s power and authority as general partner are modified in the partnership agreement of the Partnership, then the power and authority delegated to us will be modified on the same basis. The delegation of control agreement can be amended by all parties to the agreement except for any amendment that, in the sole discretion of our board of directors, would reduce the time for any notice to which owners of our shares are entitled or would materially adversely affect the rights or preferences of the holders of our shares. EMPLOYEES We have entered into agreements with the General Partner and several of its affiliates to provide us with the necessary services and support personnel, who act on our behalf as our agents.

Information contained on our website is not part of this report. 2 Table of Contents °Item 1A. Risk Factors We encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors described below, in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows depend on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Partnership. Consequently, risks and uncertainties affecting the Partnership will directly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could cause our actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein. Specifically, see information regarding forward-looking statements and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and its subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act for a discussion of risks to the Partnership that also may affect us. We incorporate by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Partnership s 10-K. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS Because our only assets are the i-units issued by the Partnership to us, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows depend solely on our management and the performance of the Partnership. We are a limited partner of the Partnership and our only assets are the i-units that the Partnership has issued to us. As a result, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows depend entirely on the Partnership s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The risks and uncertainties that affect the Partnership, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows also affect us and the value of our Listed Shares. The distributions of additional shares that we make to our shareholders depend on the amount of cash that the Partnership distributes to the holders of its Class A and B common units. When the Partnership makes a cash distribution to the holders of its Class A and B common units, we distribute to each holder of our shares that fraction of a share determined by dividing the amount of the cash distribution paid by the Partnership with respect to each common unit by the average market price of one of our Listed Shares. Therefore, if the Partnership decreases the cash distributions that it pays to the holders of its common units, the value of the distributions of additional shares that we make to our shareholders will decrease as well. Our board of directors may establish cash reserves at the Partnership that it believes are necessary to fund the Partnership s future operating and capital expenditures, provide for the proper conduct of its business, comply with applicable laws or agreements to which the Partnership is a party, or provide funds for future distributions to partners. These cash reserves affect the amount of cash available for distribution by the Partnership to the holders of its common units and, consequently, the value of the distributions of additional shares that we make to our shareholders. In addition, the fraction of a share to be issued in each quarterly distribution on our outstanding shares is based on the average closing price of our shares for the 10 trading days preceding the ex-dividend date for our Listed Shares. Because the market price of our Listed Shares may vary substantially over time, the value of the additional shares that we distribute to our shareholders may vary substantially from the cash that they would have received had they owned common units of the Partnership instead of our Listed Shares. The Partnership may issue additional common units or other classes of units, and we may issue additional shares, any of which would dilute ownership interest. 3 Table of Contents The Partnership s issuance of additional common units or other classes of units or our issuance of shares, other than our quarterly distributions, may have the following effects: The amount available for distributions on each share may decrease; The relative voting power of each previously outstanding share may decrease; and The market price of the Listed Shares may decline. Additionally, the public sale by the General Partner of a significant portion of the Class B common units that it currently owns could reduce the market price of the Class A common units and, indirectly, the market price of our shares. The Partnership s partnership agreement allows the General Partner to cause the Partnership to register for public sale any units held by the General Partner or one of its affiliates. A public sale of the Class B common units currently held by the General Partner could absorb some of the trading market demand for the outstanding Class A common units, which indirectly could reduce the market price of our shares. In addition, the General Partner may sell its Class B common units in private transactions at any time, which could have a similar effect on the market for the outstanding Class A common units and, indirectly, the market for our shares. If we are not fully reimbursed or indemnified for obligations and liabilities we incur in managing the business and affairs of the Partnership, we may be unable to pay those liabilities and the value of our shares could decline. Under the delegation of control agreement, the General Partner has delegated to us management of the Partnership and its operating subsidiaries. To the extent we incur liabilities or other obligations in connection with our performance under the delegation of control agreement, we are entitled to be reimbursed or indemnified by the Partnership to the same extent as the General Partner under the Partnership s partnership agreement. In the event the Partnership and the General Partner are either unwilling or unable to reimburse or indemnify us, we likely will be unable to satisfy these liabilities or obligations. Additionally, our right to reimbursement or indemnification is limited under certain circumstances, including if we act in bad faith or if we violate laws, like the United States federal securities laws, for which indemnification may be against public policy. If in the future we cease to manage the business and affairs of the Partnership, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we cease to manage the Partnership s business and are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC, or modify our organizational structure or our contract rights to fall outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with our affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add directors who are independent of us or our affiliates. TAX RISKS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS If the Partnership were treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, the value of our shares would be substantially reduced, and the owner of our voting shares would have the right to merge us into the Partnership. The anticipated benefit of an investment in our shares depends largely on the continued treatment of the Partnership as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. Current law requires the Partnership 4 Table of Contents to derive at least 90% of its annual gross income from specific activities to continue to be treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes. The Partnership may not find it possible, regardless of its efforts, to meet this income requirement or may inadvertently fail to meet this income requirement. Current law could change so as to cause the Partnership to be treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes without regard to its sources of income or otherwise subject the Partnership to entity-level taxation. If the Partnership were to be treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, it would pay United States federal income tax on its income at the corporate tax rate, which currently is a maximum of 35%, and such treatment also may subject the Partnership to state income taxes at varying rates. Additional taxes imposed on the Partnership as a result of being treated as a corporation could substantially reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to the holders of its common units, which in turn could reduce the value of the i-units we own and the value of our Listed Shares. In addition, the automatic increase in the number of i-units that we will own after each quarterly distribution of cash to holders of common units generally would be a taxable distribution to us. Under the provisions of our limited liability company agreement and the Partnership s partnership agreement, if the Partnership were to be treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, the owner of our voting shares has the right to cause us to merge with or into the Partnership or one of its subsidiaries. As a condition to such merger, we must obtain either an opinion of counsel that such merger should be currently non-taxable to holders of our shares or a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, that such merger will be currently non-taxable to holders of our shares, except as to the consideration received for fractional shares or as to the termination of any rights or obligations related to the purchase provisions. In such an event, our shareholders would receive common units or other securities substantially similar to the common units in exchange for their shares. RISKS ARISING FROM OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH ENBRIDGE, THE GENERAL PARTNER, AND THE PARTNERSHIP Our shares are subject to purchase provisions that could result in our shareholders having to sell their shares at a time or price that may be unfavorable. If Enbridge were to exercise any of its rights to purchase our shares that are held by the public, these shareholders would be required to sell their shares for cash at a time or price that may be undesirable, and could receive an amount of cash that is less than the amount they paid for their shares. Any such sale would be taxable for United States federal income tax purposes, and the individual shareholders would recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the tax basis in the shares sold. Owners of our Listed Shares are not entitled to vote to elect our directors, and, therefore, will have little or no opportunity to influence or change our management. Owners of our Listed Shares have little or no opportunity to influence or change our management, because Enbridge indirectly owns all of our voting shares and elects all of our directors. Through the election of our directors, Enbridge indirectly controls us and the Partnership. A person or group owning 20% or more of the aggregate number of issued and outstanding common units and our shares, other than Enbridge and its affiliates, may not vote the common units or shares, which could reduce the possibility that they would receive a premium for their shares in a hostile takeover. 5 Table of Contents A person or group owning 20% or more of the aggregate number of issued and outstanding common units and our shares, other than Enbridge and its affiliates, may not vote its common units or shares, which could reduce the possibility that they would receive a premium for their shares in a hostile takeover. This limitation may: Discourage a person or group from attempting to take over control of us or the Partnership; and Reduce the price at which our shares will trade under certain circumstances. For example, this limitation could have the result of discouraging a third-party from attempting to remove the General Partner and take over our management of the Partnership by making a tender offer for the common units at a price above their trading market price. The terms of our shares may be changed without shareholder permission, because our board of directors will have the power to change the terms of our shares in ways our board determines, in its sole discretion, are not materially adverse to our shareholders. Shareholders may not like the changes, if any, to the terms of our shares made by our board of directors, and may disagree with our board s determination that the changes are not materially adverse. If a shareholder should disagree with our board s decisions, the recourse will be limited because our limited liability company agreement gives broad latitude and discretion to our board of directors and eliminates or reduces many of the fiduciary duties that our board of directors otherwise would owe to shareholders. Our limited liability company agreement limits the fiduciary duties that our directors owe to our shareholders and restricts the remedies available to our shareholders for actions taken by our board of directors that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty. Our limited liability company agreement contains provisions that modify the fiduciary duties that our board of directors otherwise would owe to our shareholders under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our limited liability company agreement: Permits our board of directors to make a number of decisions, including the determination of which factors it will consider in resolving conflicts of interest, in its sole discretion, which entitles our board of directors to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, with no duty or obligation to give consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or any shareholder; Provides that Enbridge, its affiliates, and their respective officers and directors, who in most cases are also our officers and directors, are not required to offer us any business opportunities; and Provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any other person for any act or omission taken or omitted by such director or officer, so long as such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner that such director or officer reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests. These and similar provisions in our limited liability company agreement may restrict the remedies available to our shareholders for actions taken by our board of directors that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty. The Partnership s partnership agreement contains similar provisions that modify the fiduciary duties that the board of directors of the General Partner would otherwise owe to the Partnership s unitholders under state fiduciary duty law. As the delegate of the General Partner, these provisions apply to our directors and officers in managing the business and affairs of the Partnership. Potential conflicts of interest may arise among Enbridge and its shareholders, on the one hand, and us and our shareholders and the Partnership and its unitholders, on the other hand. Because the fiduciary duties of our directors have been modified, our board of directors may be permitted to make decisions that benefit Enbridge and its shareholders or the Partnership and its unitholders more than us and our shareholders. 6 Table of Contents Conflicts of interest may arise from time to time among Enbridge and its shareholders, on the one hand, and us and our shareholders and the Partnership and its unitholders, on the other hand. Conflicts of interest may also arise from time to time between us and our shareholders, on the one hand, and the Partnership and its unitholders, on the other hand. In managing and controlling us and the Partnership, our board of directors may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict and may resolve those conflicts by making decisions that benefit Enbridge and its shareholders or the Partnership and its unitholders more than us and our shareholders. The following decisions, among others, could involve conflicts of interest: Whether the Partnership or Enbridge will pursue certain acquisitions or other business opportunities; Whether the Partnership will issue additional units or other equity securities or whether it will purchase outstanding units; Whether we will issue additional shares; The amount of payments to Enbridge and its affiliates for any services rendered for the Partnership s benefit; The amount of costs that are reimbursable to us or Enbridge by the Partnership; The enforcement of obligations owed to the Partnership by us, the General Partner and Enbridge, including obligations regarding competition between Enbridge and the Partnership; and The retention of separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us and the Partnership. In these and similar situations, any decision by our board of directors may benefit one group more than another, and in making such decisions, our board of directors may consider the interests of all groups, as well as other factors, in deciding whether to take a particular course of action. In other situations, Enbridge may take certain actions, including engaging in businesses that compete with the Partnership, that are adverse to us and our shareholders and the Partnership and its unitholders. For example, although Enbridge and its subsidiaries are generally restricted from engaging in any business that is in direct material competition with our businesses, that restriction is subject to the following significant exceptions: Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from continuing to engage in businesses, including the normal development of such businesses, in which they were engaged at the time of the Partnership s initial public offering in December 1991; Such restriction is limited geographically only to those routes and products for which the Partnership provided transportation at the time of its initial public offering; Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with the Partnership as part of a larger acquisition, so long as the majority of the value of the business or assets acquired, in Enbridge s reasonable judgment, is not attributable to the competitive business; and Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with the Partnership if that business is first offered for acquisition to the Partnership and our board of directors and the Partnership s unitholders determine not to pursue the acquisition. Since the Partnership was not engaged in any aspect of the natural gas business at the time of its initial public offering, Enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from competing with the Partnership in any aspect 7 Table of Contents of the natural gas business. In addition, Enbridge and its subsidiaries would be permitted to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum over routes that are not the same as the Partnership s Lakehead system, even if such transportation is in direct material competition with the Partnership s business. These exceptions also expressly permitted the reversal by Enbridge in 1999 of one of its pipelines that extends from Sarnia, Ontario to Montreal, Quebec. As a result of this reversal, Enbridge competes with the Partnership to supply crude oil to the Ontario, Canada market. In the event of a liquidation of the Partnership not resulting from any action taken by the Partnership or otherwise approved by us at the direction of our shareholders, the value of our shares would likely decline. The Partnership may not take any action to cause a liquidation of the Partnership unless, prior to such liquidation, Enbridge has agreed to purchase all of our shares or we have voted to approve such liquidation at the direction of our shareholders. In the event of a liquidation of the Partnership not resulting from any action taken by the Partnership or otherwise approved by us at the direction of our shareholders, the value of our shares will depend on the after-tax amount of the liquidating distribution received by us as the owner of i-units. The terms of the i-units provide that no allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction will be made in respect of the i-units until such time as there is a liquidation of the Partnership. If there is a liquidation of the Partnership, it is intended that we will be allocated income and gain in an amount necessary for the capital account attributable to each i-unit to be equal to that of a common unit. As a result, we likely will realize taxable income upon the liquidation of the Partnership. However, there may not be sufficient amounts of income and gain to cause the capital account attributable to each i-unit to be equal to that of a common unit. If they are not equal, we and, therefore, our shareholders will receive less value than would be received by an owner of common units. In that event, the liquidating distribution per common unit will exceed the liquidating distribution per i-unit. Further, the tax indemnity provided to us by Enbridge only indemnifies us for our tax liabilities arising out of a transaction involving the i-units to the extent we have not received sufficient cash in the transaction generating the tax liability to pay the associated tax. Prior to any liquidation of the Partnership, we do not expect to receive cash in a taxable transaction. If a liquidation of the Partnership occurs, however, we likely would receive cash which we would use, at least in part, to pay taxes. As a result, our residual value and the value of our shares will likely be less than the value of the common units upon the liquidation of the Partnership. °Item 2. Properties None. °Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are a participant in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these proceedings are covered, in whole or in part, by insurance. We believe that the outcome of all these proceedings will not, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 8 Table of Contents PART II °Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity and Related Shareholder Matters Our Listed Shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol EEQ. The quarterly price ranges per Listed Share are summarized as follows: First Second Third Fourth 2012 Quarters High $ 35.54 $ 32.78 $ 35.56 $ 32.65 Low $ 31.64 $ 29.53 $ 30.20 $ 27.82 2011 Quarters High $ 33.88 $ 34.47 $ 31.27 $ 34.93 Low $ 30.65 $ 29.18 $ 25.76 $ 25.29 On February 13, 2013, the last reported sales price of the Listed Shares on the NYSE was $29.83. As of January 31, 2013, there were approximately 12,000 holders of our Listed Shares, which includes individual participants in security position listings. Distributions. Under the terms of our limited liability company agreement, except in connection with our liquidation, we do not pay distributions on our Listed Shares in cash, but instead make distributions on our Listed Shares in additional shares or fractions of shares. At the same time the Partnership makes a distribution on its common units and i-units, we distribute on each of our shares that fraction of a share determined by dividing the amount of the cash distribution to be made by the Partnership on each common unit by the average market price of a Listed Share determined for the ten-trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date for our Listed Shares. The following table sets forth the details regarding our share distributions, approved by our board of directors for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Distribution Declaration Date Record Date Distribution Payment Date Distribution per Unit of the Partnership Average Closing Price of the Listed Shares Additional i-units owned Listed Shares distributed to Public Shares distributed to General Partner (in millions, except per unit amounts) 2012 October 31 November 7 November 14 $ 0.54350 $ 31.65 695,596 578,472 117,124 July 30 August 7 August 14 $ 0.54350 $ 31.43 688,548 572,611 115,937 April 30 May 7 May 15 $ 0.53250 $ 32.28 646,118 537,325 108,793 January 30 February 7 February 14 $ 0.53250 $ 34.12 601,828 500,493 101,335 2,632,090 2,188,901 443,189 2011 October 28 November 4 November 14 $ 0.53250 $ 30.28 651,705 539,467 112,238 July 28 August 5 August 12 $ 0.53250 $ 30.13 643,589 532,749 110,840 April 28 May 6 May 13 $ 0.51375 $ 33.25 554,016 458,602 95,414 January 28 (1) February 4 February 14 $ 0.51375 $ 31.75 570,918 472,593 98,325 2,420,228 2,003,411 416,817 (1) Amounts have been adjusted for the April 2011 stock split. 9 Table of Contents In 2012 and 2011, we had non-cash investing activities in the form of the distributions from the i-units and corresponding non-cash financing activities in the form of the distributions to the shareholders of our Listed Shares of $85.0 million and $75.7 million, respectively. On January 30, 2013, our board of directors declared a share distribution payable on February 14, 2013, to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2013, based on the $0.54350 per common unit distribution declared by the Partnership. The Partnership s distribution increases the number of i-units we own. The number of i-units we received from the Partnership on February 14, 2013 was 735,227. The total i-units distributed to us was computed by dividing $0.54350, the cash amount distributed per common unit, by $30.45, the average closing price of the Listed Shares on the NYSE for the 10 trading days prior to the ex-dividend date, multiplied by 41,198,424, the number of shares outstanding prior to the distribution. We distributed additional Listed Shares to the holders of our Listed Shares and additional voting shares to the General Partner in respect of these additional i-units. Other Matters. In November 2011, we completed a private offering of 860,684 Listed Shares to First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund, representing limited liability company interests in us with limited voting rights, at a price of $29.86 per Listed Share. We received net proceeds of $25.5 million, which were subsequently invested in an equal number of the Partnership s i-units. There were no similar offerings for the year ended December 31, 2012. °Item 6.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes beginning on page 18 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on May 14, 2002. We have elected to be treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. Our sole investment is all of a special class of units issued by the Partnership, referred to as i-units, representing limited partner interests in the Partnership. The General Partner owns all of our voting shares and is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Enbridge. By agreement with the Partnership, the General Partner and us, we manage the business and affairs of the Partnership, subject to the General Partner s right to approve specified actions. The information set forth under Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, is hereby incorporated by reference as our results of operation, cash flows and financial position are dependent on the results of operation, cash flows and financial position of the Partnership. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our results of operations consist of our share of earnings of the Partnership attributed to the i-units we own. At each of December 31, 2012 and 2011, through our ownership of i-units, we had an approximate 13.3% limited partner interest in the Partnership and at December 31, 2010, an approximate 13.7% limited partnership interest. Our percentage ownership of the Partnership will change over time as the number of i-units we own becomes a different percentage of the total limited partner interests outstanding due to our ownership of additional i-units and other issuances of limited partner interests by the Partnership. The following table presents the Partnership s allocation of net income to the General Partner and limited partners for the periods presented. For the year ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in millions) Net income (loss) attributable to general and limited partner ownership interests in Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. $ 493.1 $ 624.0 $ (198.5 ) Less: Net income allocated to General Partner (126.3 ) (105.6 ) (63.1 ) Net income (loss) allocated to limited partners $ 366.8 $ 518.4 $ (261.6 ) Our net income of $31.8 million and $45.5 million, and net loss of $23.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, represents equity in earnings and losses attributable to the i-units that we own decreased by deferred income tax expense. Deferred income tax expense is calculated based on the difference between the accounting and tax basis of our investment in the Partnership and the combined U.S. federal and state income tax rate of 37.0% for both 2012 and 2011, and 37.7% in 2010, applied to our share of the earnings of the Partnership for the respective periods. 11 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2012 compared with year ended December 31, 2011 For the year ended December 31, 2012, our net income decreased by $13.7 million resulting in net income of $31.8 million as compared with the same period in 2011. The decrease is primarily attributable to the $21.8 million decrease in equity income from the Partnership compared to the same period in 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Partnership had higher operating and administrative expenses in each of its Liquids and Natural Gas segments. This increase in operating costs was primarily due to increased allocation expenses, additional workforce costs, regulatory support, property tax and integrity costs related to the expansion of its systems. As a result, our equity income was reduced by $12.4 million, after tax, which related to these increased operating costs. In June 2011, the Partnership recognized a settlement related to a dispute with a shipper for oil measurement adjustments the Partnership previously recognized in prior years, which positively impacted our equity income by $4.6 million, after tax. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2011, our equity income included a $1.5 million after tax decrease of equity income we recorded for our share of cumulative aggregate costs recognized by the Partnership during the year ended December 31, 2011 for previously misstated NGL product purchases and sales that occurred at the Partnership s wholly-owned trucking and NGL marketing subsidiary over a period from at least 2005 through 2011. We recognized the additional equity loss following our determination that the previously unrecognized amounts were not material to the current or any prior period. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2011, our equity income was understated by approximately $2.8 million after tax, which related to accounting misstatements for the Partnership s NGL product purchases and sales made for the year ended December 31, 2010 that were recorded in 2011. Capital Account Adjustments on Issuances of Common Units by the Partnership The Partnership records an adjustment to the carrying value of its book capital accounts when it issues additional common units and the new issuance price per unit is greater than or less than the average cost per unit for each class of units. We refer to these adjustments as capital account adjustments. Beginning January 1, 2009, in conjunction with our adoption of the authoritative accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests , we recognize any capital account adjustments recorded by the Partnership to the book capital account it maintains for our i-units by increasing or decreasing our investment in the Partnership and recording a corresponding capital account adjustment directly to Shareholders equity on our statements of financial position. We adopted prospectively the applicable authoritative guidance, except for any relevant presentation and disclosure requirements. Prior to our adoption of this guidance, we historically recognized the capital account adjustment recorded by the Partnership to the book capital account it maintains for our i-units by increasing or decreasing our investment in the Partnership and recording a corresponding gain or loss in our statements of income. Gain or loss recognition is an accounting convention we have historically applied as our method of recognizing these capital account adjustments made by the Partnership. Issuance of Listed Shares In November 2011, we completed a private offering of 860,684 Listed Shares to First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund, representing limited liability company interests in us with limited voting rights, at a price of $29.86 per Listed Share. We received net proceeds of $25.5 million, which were subsequently invested in an equal number of the Partnership s i-units. There were no similar offerings for the year ended December 31, 2012. 12 Table of Contents Partnership Issuances of Class A Common Units The following table presents the issuances of additional Class A common units by the Partnership for the years presented, excluding issuances under the Partnership s Equity Distribution Agreement, or EDA, and the Partnership s Amended and Restated Equity Distribution Agreement, or Amended EDA.

(2) Before the effect of income taxes. (3) Shares and unit prices adjusted for the April 2011 stock split. Equity Distribution Agreement In June 2010, the Partnership entered into the EDA for the issue and sale from time to time of its Class A common units up to an aggregate amount of $150.0 million. On May 27, 2011, the Partnership entered into the Amended EDA for the issue and sale from time to time of its Class A common units up to an aggregate amount of $500.0 million from the execution of the agreement through May 20, 2014. The units issued under the Amended EDA are in addition to the units offered and sold under the original EDA. During the period from execution of the EDA through May 25, 2011, the Partnership sold 2,118,025 Class A common units, representing 4,236,050 units after giving effect to a two-for-one split of its Class A common units that became effective on April 21, 2011, for aggregate gross proceeds of $124.8 million of which $64.5 million are gross proceeds received in 2011, and no further sales were made under that agreement. On May 27, 2011, the Partnership de-registered the remaining aggregate $25.2 million of Class A common units that were registered under the EDA and remained unsold as of that date. 13 Table of Contents The following table presents the net proceeds from the Partnership s Class A common unit issuances, resulting from the EDA or the Amended EDA, during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and there were no similar issuances in 2012: Issuance Date (1) Number of Class A common units Issued Average Offering Price per Class A common unit Net Proceeds to the Partnership (1) Ownership Percentage in the Partnership Prior to the Issuance Ownership Percentage in the Partnership After the Issuance Increases in the Book Value of Investment (2) (in millions, except units and per unit amounts) 2011 January 1 to March 31 (3) 1,773,448 $ 32.26 $ 55.9 13.9 % 13.8 % $ 4.1 April 1 to May 26 (3) 225,200 $ 32.16 7.0 13.8 % 14.0 % 0.5 May 27 to June 30 (4) 333,794 $ 30.30 9.9 14.0 % 14.0 % 0.7 July 1 to September 30 (4) 751,766 $ 28.38 20.8 13.7 % 13.3 % 1.1 2011 Totals 3,084,208 $ 93.6 $6.4 2010 April 1 to June 30 (3) 574,690 $ 26.26 $ 14.8 14.1 % 14.1 % $ 0.7 July 1 to September 30 (3) 1,373,482 $ 27.11 36.3 14.3 % 14.2 % 1.8 October 1 to December 31 (3) 289,230 $ 27.85 7.6 14.2 % 14.2 % 0.5 2010 Totals 2,237,402 $ 58.7 $3.0 (1) Net of commissions and issuance costs of $2.2 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. (2) Contributions made by the General Partner to maintain its 2% general partner interest. (3) Units and unit price adjusted for the April 2011 stock split. (4) Units issued under the Amended EDA. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded $22.7 million, $51.7 million and $28.5 million, respectively, of capital account adjustments with respect to all the Partnership s Class A common unit issuances, including any EDA or Amended EDA issuances. The after-tax effect of these capital account adjustments to our Shareholders equity at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $14.4 million, $32.6 million and $17.9 million, respectively. Year ended December 31, 2011 compared with year ended December 31, 2010 For the year ended December 31, 2011, our net income increased by $69.2 million resulting in a net income of $45.5 million as compared with the same period in 2010. The growth was primarily attributable to the $110.5 million increase in equity income from the Partnership compared to the same period in 2010. In June 2011, the Partnership recognized a settlement related to a dispute with a shipper for oil measurement adjustments the Partnership previously recognized in prior years, which positively impacted our equity income by $7.2 million. In addition, our equity income for the year ended December 31, 2011 also includes a $2.4 million decrease of equity income we recorded for our share of cumulative aggregate costs recognized by the Partnership during the year ended December 31, 2011 for previously misstated NGL product purchases and sales that occurred at the Partnership s wholly-owned trucking and NGL marketing subsidiary over a period from at least 2005 through 2011. We recognized the additional equity loss following our determination that the previously unrecognized amounts were not material to the current or any prior period. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2011, our equity income was understated by approximately $4.5 million, which related to accounting misstatements for the Partnership s NGL product purchases and sales made for the year ended December 31, 2010 that were recorded in 2011. 14 Table of Contents During 2010, the Partnership incurred environmental costs from two crude oil releases that adversely affected its operating results and consequently the equity income we derive from the Partnership s operations. As a result of the crude oil releases, we recognized $52.4 million, after taxes, of equity income losses on our statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2010. Comparatively, in 2011, the Partnership received insurance proceeds related to the Line 6B crude oil release that were partially offset by additional accruals for the two crude oil releases, where the remaining amount positively impacted our equity income by $9.8 million, after taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recorded a total of $51.7 million and $28.5 million, respectively, in capital account adjustments in relation to the Partnership s Class A common unit issuances. The net after-tax effect of these capital account adjustments on our December 31, 2011 and 2010 statements of shareholders equity was $32.6 million and $17.9 million, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our authorized capital structure consists of two classes of limited liability company interests: (1) our Listed Shares, which are traded on the NYSE and represent limited liability company interests with limited voting rights, and (2) our voting shares, which represent limited liability company interests with full voting rights. At December 31, 2012, our issued capitalization consisted of $981.7 million associated with our 41,198,420 Listed Shares outstanding. The number of our shares outstanding, including the voting shares owned by the General Partner, will at all times equal the number of i-units we own in the Partnership. Typically, the General Partner and owners of the Partnership s Class A and B common units will receive distributions from the Partnership in cash. Instead of receiving cash distributions on the i-units we own, however, we receive additional i-units under the terms of the Partnership s limited partnership agreement. The amount of additional i-units we receive is calculated by dividing the amount of the cash distribution paid by the Partnership on each of its Class A and B common units by the average closing price of one of our Listed Shares on the NYSE for the 10 trading day period immediately preceding the ex-dividend date for our shares, multiplied by the number of our shares outstanding on the record date. We make share distributions to our shareholders concurrently with the i-unit distributions we receive from the Partnership that increases the number of i-units we own. As a result of our share distributions, the number of shares outstanding is equal to the number of i-units that we own in the Partnership. We used substantially all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to purchase i-units from the Partnership and to compensate Enbridge, the ultimate parent company of the General Partner, for its purchase provisions and tax indemnities. Under the Enbridge purchase provisions, which are a part of our limited liability company agreement, Enbridge has the right and obligation, under limited circumstances, to purchase our outstanding shares. In addition, Enbridge generally agreed to indemnify us for any tax liability attributable to our formation, our management of the Partnership or our ownership of the i-units. Additionally, Enbridge generally agreed to indemnify us for any taxes arising from a transaction involving the i-units to the extent the transaction does not generate cash sufficient to pay such taxes, in each case, other than any Texas franchise taxes or other capital-based foreign, state or local taxes that are required to be paid or reimbursed by the Partnership under the delegation of control agreement. If we incur liabilities or other obligations in connection with the performance of our obligations under the delegation of control agreement, we are entitled to be reimbursed or to be indemnified by the Partnership or the General Partner. Thus, we expect that our expenditures associated with managing the business and affairs of the Partnership and the reimbursement of these expenses that we receive will continue to be equal. As previously stated, we do not receive quarterly distributions of cash on the i-units we hold. Therefore, we expect neither to generate nor to require significant amounts of cash in ongoing operations. Any net cash proceeds we receive from the sale of additional shares will immediately be used to purchase additional i-units. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any other sources of or needs for additional liquidity. 15 Table of Contents We are not permitted to borrow money or incur debt other than with Enbridge and its affiliates without the approval of holders owning at least a majority of our shares. INCOME TAXES We are a limited liability company that has elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. The delegation of control agreement states that the General Partner bears the economic impact for our taxes only in the event we do not have cash sufficient to pay them. Accordingly, we accrue state income taxes in addition to federal income taxes. The effective tax rate we have used in computing the income tax provision in 2012 and 2011 is 37.0%, which represents the federal statutory rate of 35.0% and the effective state rate of 2.0%. Our income tax expense of $18.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2012, is $8.1 million less than the income tax expense we incurred for the corresponding period in 2011. The decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 was due to the decrease in our taxable income primarily associated with reduced amounts of equity income we recognized from the Partnership. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Share Distribution On January 30, 2013, our board of directors declared a share distribution payable on February 14, 2013, to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2013, based on the $0.54350 per limited partner unit distribution declared by the Partnership. The Partnership s distribution increased the number of i-units that we own. The number of i-units we received from the Partnership on February 14, 2013 was 735,227. The amount of this increase is calculated by dividing $0.54350, the cash amount distributed by the Partnership per common unit by $30.45, the average closing price of one of our Listed Shares on the NYSE for the 10 trading day period immediately preceding the ex-dividend date for our shares, multiplied by 41,198,424, the number of shares outstanding on the record date. We distributed an additional 611,430 Listed Shares to our Listed shareholders and 123,797 shares to the General Partner in respect of these additional i-units. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which we refer to as United States GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with United States GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Any effects on the financial statements resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Accounting for Investment in the Partnership We use the equity method of accounting for our ownership interest in the Partnership s net income and comprehensive income because we exercise significant influence over the Partnership. We record our share of earnings of the Partnership in the period in which it is earned. At each of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we owned approximately 13.3%, and at December 31, 2010, we owned approximately 13.7% of the Partnership, respectively. Our ownership percentage changes as the Partnership issues additional limited partner units. Changes in the calculation of our ownership percentage affects our net income and comprehensive income. 16 Table of Contents Capital Account Adjustments on Issuances of Common Units by the Partnership The Partnership records an adjustment to the carrying value of its book capital accounts when it issues additional common units and the new issuance price per unit is greater than or less than the average cost per unit for each class of units. We refer to these adjustments as capital account adjustments. Beginning January 1, 2009, in conjunction with our adoption of the authoritative accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests , we recognize any capital account adjustments recorded by the Partnership to the book capital account it maintains for our i-units by increasing or decreasing our investment in the Partnership and recording a corresponding capital account adjustment directly to Shareholders equity on our statements of financial position. Prior to our adoption of this guidance, we historically recognized the capital account adjustment recorded by the Partnership to the book capital account it maintains for our i-units by increasing or decreasing our investment in the Partnership and recording a corresponding gain or loss in our statements of income. Gain or loss recognition is an accounting convention we have historically applied as our method of recognizing these capital account adjustments made by the Partnership. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED Accounting Standards Update Presentation of Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, as part of the FASB s joint project with the IASB, requiring presentation of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. The guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity and the disclosure of reclassification adjustments in the footnotes. The guidance does not change which components of comprehensive income are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income, when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income or the earnings-per-share computation. The accounting update is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2011. On December 23, 2011, the FASB issued an amendment, Accounting Standards No. 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, deferring the requirement to measure and present reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income by income statement line item in net income and also in other comprehensive income. As such, entities will continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the requirements in effect before adoption of the new standard. The deferral is effective at the same time that the new standard is adopted. °Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The nature of our business and operations is such that no activities or transactions of the type requiring discussion under this item are conducted. For a discussion of these matters as they pertain to the Partnership, please read Part II, Item 7A.

(the Company ) at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ P RICEWATERHOUSE C OOPERS LLP Houston, Texas February 14, 2013 19 Table of Contents ENBRIDGE ENERGY MANAGEMENT, L.L.C.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. GENERAL Enbridge Energy Management, L.L.C., referred to herein as we, us, our, the Company, or Enbridge Management, is a publicly traded Delaware limited liability company that was formed on May 14, 2002. Our listed shares, or Listed Shares, are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol EEQ. We are a limited partner of Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P., which we also refer to as the Partnership, through our ownership of i-units, a special class of the Partnership s limited partner interests. The Partnership s Class A common units are traded on the NYSE under the symbol EEP, which together with the Class B common units, we refer to as common units. Under a delegation of control agreement with the Partnership and its general partner, Enbridge Energy Company, Inc., or the General Partner, we manage the Partnership s business and affairs. The General Partner is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Enbridge Inc., a leading energy transportation and distribution company located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, which we refer to as Enbridge. The General Partner owns 4.48 voting shares, which is 100% of our voting shares, as well as 6,936,939 Listed Shares, which is 16.8% of our Listed Shares, while the remaining 34,261,481 Listed Shares, which is 83.2% of our Listed Shares, were held by the public at December 31, 2012. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable under the circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. We record the effect of any revisions to these estimates in our financial statements in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Accounting for Investment in the Partnership We use the equity method of accounting for our ownership in the Partnership because we exercise significant influence over the Partnership pursuant to a delegation of control agreement among the General Partner, the Partnership and us. Our share of earnings of the Partnership is recorded in the period in which it is earned. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we owned approximately 13.3% of the Partnership. Capital Account Adjustments on Issuances of Common Units by the Partnership The Partnership records an adjustment to the carrying value of its book capital accounts when it issues additional common units and the new issuance price per unit is greater than or less than the average cost per unit for each class of units. We refer to these adjustments as capital account adjustments. Beginning January 1, 2009, in conjunction with our adoption of the authoritative accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests , we recognize any capital account adjustments recorded by the Partnership to the book capital account it maintains for our i-units by increasing or decreasing our investment in the Partnership and recording a corresponding capital account adjustment directly to Shareholders equity on our statements of financial position. We adopted prospectively the applicable authoritative guidance, except for any relevant presentation and disclosure requirements. Prior to our adoption of this guidance, we historically recognized the capital account adjustment recorded by the Partnership to the book capital account it maintains for our i-units by increasing or decreasing our investment in the Partnership and recording a corresponding gain or loss in our statements of income. Gain or loss recognition is an accounting convention we have historically applied as our method of recognizing these capital account adjustments made by the Partnership. 25 Table of Contents Net Income Per Share Both basic and diluted earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average number of our shares outstanding during each period. We have no securities outstanding that may be converted into or exercised for our shares. Income Taxes We are a limited liability company that has elected to be treated as a corporation for U. S. federal income tax purposes. We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the basis of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which the legislation is enacted. Currently, the only temporary difference (and associated deferred tax expense) results from recording our equity in the earnings of the Partnership which will not become taxable until the Partnership is liquidated, or the i-units are otherwise monetized. We are a party to a tax indemnification agreement with Enbridge. Pursuant to this tax indemnification agreement, Enbridge agrees to indemnify us from any tax liability attributable to our formation or our management of the business and affairs of the Partnership and from any taxes arising out of a transaction involving the i-units owned, to the extent the transaction does not generate cash sufficient to pay our taxes with respect to such transaction, in each case, other than any Texas franchise taxes and other capital-based foreign, state or local taxes that are required to be paid or reimbursed by the Partnership under the delegation of control agreement. The delegation of control agreement states that the General Partner bears the economic impact for our taxes only in the event we do not have cash sufficient to pay them. As a result, we accrue state income taxes in addition to federal income tax. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes Pursuant to the authoritative accounting guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize the tax effects of any uncertain tax positions as the largest amount that will more likely than not be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. This guidance has not materially affected our operating results, cash flows or financial position. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income differs from net income due to the equity in other comprehensive income or loss of the Partnership. The Partnership enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to commodity price and interest rate risk, most of which are qualified cash flow hedges under the applicable authoritative accounting guidance for derivative activities . As such, changes in the fair market value of the Partnership s derivative financial instruments produce fluctuations in our comprehensive income, which is reflected as equity in other comprehensive income or loss of the Partnership. 3. SHARE SPLIT Our Listed Shares are traded on the NYSE. On February 18, 2011, our board of directors approved a split of our Listed and voting shares effected by a distribution on April 21, 2011 of one Listed Share for each Listed Share outstanding and one voting share for each voting share outstanding to shareholders of record on April 7, 2011. The net income per share and weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2010 presented in our statements of income and the number of shares presented in our statements of shareholders equity are presented reflecting the retrospective effects of the share split. 26 Table of Contents 4. SHARE DISTRIBUTIONS Our authorized capital structure consists of two classes of interests: (1) Listed Shares, which represent limited liability company interests with limited voting rights, and (2) voting shares, which represent limited liability company interests with full voting rights, all voting shares of which are held by the General Partner. Prior to the October 17, 2002 initial public offering of our Listed Shares, our issued capitalization consisted of cash contributed by the General Partner for one voting share. We make share distributions on a quarterly basis at the same time that the Partnership declares and makes cash distributions to the General Partner and the holders of its Class A and B common units. We do not, however, receive distributions of cash on the i-units we own and do not otherwise have any cash flow attributable to our ownership of the i-units. Instead, when the Partnership makes distributions of cash to the General Partner and holders of its Class A and B common units, we receive additional i-units under the terms of the Partnership s partnership agreement. The amount of the additional i-units we receive is calculated by dividing the amount of the per unit cash distribution paid by the Partnership on each of its Class A and B common units by the average closing price of one of our Listed Shares on the NYSE as determined for a 10 trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date for our shares multiplied by the number of shares outstanding on the record date. We concurrently distribute additional shares to our shareholders that are equivalent in number to the additional i-units we receive from the Partnership. As a result, the number of our outstanding shares is equal to the number of i-units that we own in the Partnership. The following table sets forth the details regarding our share distributions, as approved by our board of directors for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

CAPITAL ACCOUNT ADJUSTMENTS ON ISSUANCES OF COMMON UNITS BY THE PARTNERSHIP The Partnership records an adjustment to the carrying value of its book capital accounts when it issues additional common units and the new issuance price per unit is greater than or less than the average cost per unit for each class of units. We refer to these adjustments as capital account adjustments. Beginning January 1, 2009, in conjunction with our adoption of the authoritative accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests , we recognize any capital account adjustments recorded by the Partnership to the book capital account it maintains for our i-units by increasing or decreasing our investment in the Partnership and recording a corresponding capital account adjustment directly to Shareholders equity on our statements of financial position. We adopted prospectively the applicable authoritative guidance, except for any relevant presentation and disclosure requirements. Prior to our adoption of this guidance, we historically recognized the capital account adjustment recorded by the Partnership to the book capital account it maintains for our i-units by increasing or decreasing our investment in the Partnership and recording a corresponding gain or loss in our statements of income. Gain or loss recognition is an accounting convention we have historically applied as our method of recognizing these capital account adjustments made by the Partnership. Issuance of Listed Shares In November 2011, we completed a private offering of 860,684 Listed Shares to First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund, representing limited liability company interests in us with limited voting rights, at a price of $29.86 per Listed Share. We received net proceeds of $25.5 million, which were subsequently invested in an equal number of the Partnership s i-units.

Equity Distribution Agreement In June 2010, the Partnership entered into the EDA for the issue and sale from time to time of its Class A common units up to an aggregate amount of $150.0 million. On May 27, 2011, the Partnership entered into the Amended EDA for the issue and sale from time to time of its Class A common units up to an aggregate amount of $500.0 million from the execution of the agreement through May 20, 2014. The units issued under the Amended EDA are in addition to the units offered and sold under the original EDA. During the period from execution of the EDA through May 25, 2011, the Partnership sold 2,118,025 Class A common units, representing 4,236,050 units after giving effect to a two-for-one split of its Class A common units that became effective on April 21, 2011, for aggregate gross proceeds of $124.8 million of which $64.5 million are gross proceeds received in 2011, and no further sales were made under that agreement.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS At the time of our initial public offering, we became a limited partner in the Partnership and, pursuant to a delegation of control agreement among us, the General Partner and the Partnership, assumed the management of the Partnership s business and affairs. Pursuant to this agreement, we have assumed substantially all of the General Partner s power and authority to manage the business and affairs of the Partnership and its subsidiaries. The delegation of control agreement provides that we will not amend or propose to amend the Partnership s partnership agreement, allow a merger or consolidation involving the Partnership, allow a sale or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership or dissolve or liquidate the Partnership without the approval of the General Partner. The General Partner remains responsible to the Partnership for actions taken or omitted by us while serving as the delegate of the General Partner as if the General Partner had itself taken or omitted to take such actions. The General Partner owns all of our voting shares. The General Partner has agreed not to voluntarily withdraw as general partner of the Partnership and has agreed not to transfer its interest as general partner of the Partnership unless the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of the delegation of control agreement that apply to the General Partner. 30 Table of Contents The Partnership recognizes the delegation of rights and powers to us and indemnifies and protects us and our officers and directors to the same extent as it does with respect to the General Partner. In addition, the Partnership reimburses our expenses to the same extent as it does with respect to the General Partner as general partner. The Partnership also reimburses us for any Texas franchise taxes and any other similar capital-based foreign, state and local taxes not otherwise paid or reimbursed by Enbridge pursuant to the tax indemnification agreement. The General Partner, we and Enbridge, through its affiliates, provide the Partnership with managerial, administrative, operational and director services pursuant to service agreements among all of us. Pursuant to these service agreements, the Partnership reimburses us, the General Partner and affiliates of Enbridge for the costs of these managerial, administrative, operational and director services.

INCOME TAXES Our long-term deferred income tax liability of $143.8 million and $117.0 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, results from the deferred income tax expense associated with recording our equity in earnings of the Partnership and our share of the other comprehensive income of the Partnership.

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had no liability reported for unrecognized tax benefits.

SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE PARTNERSHIP The Partnership is a publicly-traded Delaware limited partnership that owns and operates crude oil and liquid petroleum transportation and storage assets and natural gas gathering, treating, processing, transportation and marketing assets in the United States of America. The following table provides summarized financial information of the Partnership: For the years ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in millions) Operating revenue $ 6,706.1 $ 9,109.8 $ 7,736.1 Operating expenses 5,812.9 8,113.0 7,608.8 Operating income $ 893.2 $ 996.8 $ 127.3 Net income (loss) $ 550.1 $ 677.2 $ (137.9 ) Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 57.0 53.2 60.6 Net income (loss) attributable to Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. $ 493.1 $ 624.0 $ (198.5 ) Current assets $ 1,087.9 $ 1,319.4 $ 1,219.9 Long-term assets $ 11,708.9 $ 10,050.7 $ 9,221.1 Current liabilities $ 1,634.0 $ 1,450.2 $ 1,317.9 Long-term liabilities $ 5,914.9 $ 5,307.8 $ 5,237.6 Noncontrolling interest $ 793.5 $ 445.5 $ 465.4 Partners capital $ 5,247.9 $ 4,612.1 $ 3,885.5 9. EQUITY INCOME FROM THE PARTNERSHIP Our operating results, cash flows and financial position are dependent on the results of operations, cash flows and financial position of the Partnership. As a result, items that affect the operating results, cash flows and financial position of the Partnership will affect the amounts we report in our financial statements in proportion to our percentage ownership of the Partnership. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Partnership had higher operating and administrative expenses in each of its Liquids and Natural Gas segments. This increase in operating costs was primarily due to increased allocated expenses, additional workforce costs, regulatory support costs, property taxes and integrity costs related to the expansion of its systems. As a result, our equity income was reduced by $12.4 million, after tax, which related to these increased operating costs. In June 2011, the Partnership recognized a settlement related to a dispute with a shipper for oil measurement adjustments the Partnership previously recognized in prior years, which positively impacted our equity income by $4.6 million after taxes. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2011, our equity income included a $1.5 million after tax decrease of equity income we recorded for our share of cumulative aggregate costs recognized by the Partnership during the year ended December 31, 2011 for previously misstated NGL product purchases and sales that occurred at the Partnership s wholly-owned trucking and NGL marketing subsidiary over a period from at least 2005 through 2011. We recognized the additional equity loss following our determination that the previously unrecognized amounts were not material to the current or any prior period. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2011, our equity income was understated by approximately $2.8 million after tax, which related to accounting misstatements for the Partnership s NGL product purchases and sales made for the year ended December 31, 2010 that were recorded in 2011. 32 Table of Contents In July and September 2010, the Partnership sustained losses from two crude oil releases that adversely affected its operating results and consequently the equity income we derive from the Partnership s operations. As a result of the crude oil releases, the Partnership recognized $52.4 million, after taxes, of equity losses in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010. 10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Share Distribution On January 30, 2013, our board of directors declared a share distribution payable on February 14, 2013, to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2013, based on the $0.54350 per limited partner unit distribution declared by the Partnership. The Partnership s distribution increased the number of i-units that we own. The number of i-units we received from the Partnership on February 14, 2013 was 735,227. The amount of this increase is calculated by dividing $0.54350, the cash amount distributed by the Partnership per common unit by $30.45, the average closing price of one of our Listed Shares on the NYSE for the 10 trading day period immediately preceding the ex-dividend date for our shares, multiplied by 41,198,424, the number of shares outstanding on the record date. We distributed an additional 611,430 Listed Shares to our Listed shareholders and 123,797 shares to the General Partner in respect of these additional i-units. 11. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED Accounting Standards Update Presentation of Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, as part of the FASB s joint project with the IASB, requiring presentation of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. The guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity and the disclosure of reclassification adjustments in the footnotes. The guidance does not change which components of comprehensive income are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income, when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income or the earnings-per-share computation. The accounting update is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2011. On December 23, 2011, the FASB issued an amendment, Accounting Standards No. 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, deferring the requirement to measure and present reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income by income statement line item in net income and also in other comprehensive income. As such, entities will continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the requirements in effect before adoption of the new standard. The deferral is effective at the same time that the new standard is adopted. 33 Table of Contents 12.

(2) In the fourth quarter of 2012, equity income from our investment in the Partnership was negatively affected because the Partnership received no additional insurance proceeds in connection with the Line 6B crude oil release, as compared to $12.5 million, after tax, in insurance proceeds that the Partnership received in the third quarter of 2012. (3) We recognized $3.0 million, $(2.0) million, $(4.7) million and $13.5 million of equity income (loss), net of taxes, in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2011, respectively, related to additional costs, net of insurance recoveries, recognized by the Partnership related to its Line 6B and Line 6A crude oil releases.

Based on our review of the Section 16(a) filings that have been received by us and inquiries made to our directors and executive officers, we believe that all filings required to be made under Section 16(a) during 2012 and prior years were timely made, except that each of J. Richard Bird, one of our directors, and Arthur D. Meyer, one of our officers, did not timely file a Form 3 to report the number of Listed Shares beneficially held by him. GOVERNANCE MATTERS Our Board of Directors currently does not consist of a majority of independent directors. We are a controlled company, as that term is used in NYSE Rule 303A, because all of our voting shares are owned by the General Partner. Because we are a controlled company, the NYSE listing standards do not require that we or the General Partner have a majority of independent directors or a nominating or compensation committee of the General Partner s Board of Directors. The NYSE listing standards require our principal executive officer to annually certify that he is not aware of any violation by the Partnership of the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. Accordingly, this certification was provided as required to the NYSE on March 29, 2012.

None of these members are relying upon any exemptions from the foregoing independence requirements. The members of the Audit Committee are J. Herbert England, Jeffrey A. Connelly, Dan A. Westbrook, and Rebecca B. Roberts. Martha O. Hesse resigned as a director and as a member of the Audit Committee on August 14, 2012, and Rebecca B. Roberts was elected to fill the Audit Committee vacancy on July 30, 2012. Jeffrey A. Connelly resigned as chairman of the Audit Committee on July 30, 2012, and J. Herbert England was subsequently elected as chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee provides independent oversight with respect to our internal controls, accounting policies, financial reporting, internal audit function and the report of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also reviews the scope and quality, including the independence and objectivity, of the independent and internal auditors and the fees paid for both audit and non-audit work and makes recommendations concerning audit matters, including the engagement of the independent auditors, to the Board of Directors. The charter of the Audit Committee is available on our website at www.enbridgemanagement.com . The charter of the Audit Committee complies with the listing standards of the NYSE currently applicable to us. This material is available in print, free of charge, to any person who requests the information. Persons wishing to obtain this printed material should submit a request to Corporate Secretary, c/o Enbridge Energy Management, L.L.C., 1100 Louisiana Street, Suite 3300, Houston, Texas 77002. Enbridge Management s Board of Directors has determined that J. Herbert England and Jeffrey A. Connelly each qualify as audit committee financial experts as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Each of the members of the Audit Committee is independent as defined by Section 303A of the listing standards of the NYSE. Mr. England is on the Audit Committees of the General Partner and Enbridge Management. In compliance with the provisions of the Audit Committee Charter, the boards of directors of the General Partner and of Enbridge Management determined that Mr. England s simultaneous service on such audit committees does not impair his ability to effectively serve on the Audit Committee. Enbridge Management s Audit Committee has established procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints we receive regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and the confidential, anonymous submission by our employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. Persons wishing to communicate with our Audit Committee may do so by writing to the Chairman, Audit Committee, c/o Enbridge Energy Management, L.L.C., 1100 Louisiana Street, Suite 3300, Houston, Texas 77002.

Connelly serves as the presiding director at those executive sessions. Persons wishing to communicate with the Company s independent directors may do so by writing to the Chairman, Board of Directors, Enbridge Energy Management, L.L.C., 1100 Louisiana Street, Suite 3300, Houston, Texas 77002. °Item 11. Executive Compensation We do not directly employ any of the individuals responsible for managing or operating our business. We obtain managerial, administrative and operational services from the General Partner and Enbridge pursuant to service agreements among us, the General Partner and other affiliates of Enbridge. Pursuant to these service agreements, the Partnership has agreed to reimburse the General Partner and affiliates of Enbridge for the cost of managerial, administrative, operational and director services they provide to us. 44 Table of Contents The discussion of executive compensation for the Partnership is found in Part III, Item 11. Executive Compensation of the Partnership s 10-K, which is hereby incorporated by reference as the Partnership reimburses a portion of the compensation of our directors and officers for the services they provide to us, the General Partner and the Partnership. The compensation policies and philosophy of Enbridge govern the types and amount of compensation of the Named Executive Officers, or NEOs. Since these policies and philosophy are those of Enbridge, we also refer you to a discussion of those items as set forth in the Executive Compensation section of the Enbridge Management Information Circular, or MIC, on the Enbridge website at www.enbridge.com . The Enbridge MIC is produced by Enbridge pursuant to Canadian securities regulations and is not incorporated into this document by reference or deemed furnished or filed by us under the Exchange Act; rather the reference is to provide our investors with an understanding of the compensation policies and philosophy of the ultimate parent of the General Partner. 45 Table of Contents °Item 12.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND RELATED AGREEMENTS Under the delegation of control agreement, the General Partner delegated, and we assumed, all of the General Partner s power and authority to manage the business and affairs of the Partnership and its subsidiaries subject to certain approval rights retained by the General Partner. The Partnership has agreed to reimburse us under the delegation of control agreement for any direct and indirect expenses we incur to the same extent as it does with respect to the General Partner as general partner. In addition, the Partnership will reimburse us for any Texas franchise taxes and any other foreign, state and local taxes not otherwise paid or reimbursed pursuant to the tax indemnification agreement between Enbridge and us. The Partnership has also agreed to indemnify and protect us and our respective officers and directors in performing these management and control functions to the same extent as it does with respect to the General Partner as general partner. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, all expenses in connection with our management of the business and affairs of the Partnership were paid by the Partnership. Because we do not have employees, we have entered into various service agreements with Enbridge and certain of its subsidiaries to fulfill our obligations under the delegation of control agreement and the agency agreement. These service agreements allow us to obtain from Enbridge and its subsidiaries various administrative, operational, technical and professional services and the use of related personnel. The Partnership directly reimburses Enbridge and its subsidiaries for the actual amount of direct and indirect expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf in connection with the services and personnel provided to us. In other cases, Enbridge allocates to its affiliates an agreed percentage of the total expenses with respect to a particular type of service provided by Enbridge to all of its affiliates and us. In either case, the Partnership pays directly or reimburses us for any amounts that we incur under the service agreements. The service agreements also provide that Enbridge and its affiliates will indemnify us for certain losses and defend us against certain claims in connection with providing or failing to provide the agreed services. Similarly, we have agreed to indemnify Enbridge and its affiliates for certain losses and defend them against certain claims as a result of their provision of the agreed services. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, expenses for services and personnel provided under the services agreements were paid by the Partnership. SUPPORTIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH ENBRIDGE In connection with our initial public offering in October 2002, we entered into a tax indemnification agreement and purchase provisions with Enbridge. Under the tax indemnification agreement, Enbridge has agreed to indemnify us for any tax liability attributable to our formation, our management of the business and affairs of the Partnership and for any taxes arising out of a transaction involving the i-units we own to the extent the transaction does not generate cash sufficient to pay our taxes with respect to such transaction. Under the purchase provisions, Enbridge has the right to purchase our outstanding Listed Shares in connection with certain significant events involving the Partnership and also whenever Enbridge owns more than 80% of our outstanding Listed Shares. We paid Enbridge $500,000 in consideration of its obligations under the tax indemnification agreement and purchase provisions. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND FIDUCIARY DUTIES Conflicts of interest may arise because of the relationship among Enbridge, the General Partner, the Partnership and us. Our directors and officers have fiduciary duties to manage our business in a manner 48 Table of Contents beneficial to us and to the holders of our shares. However, these fiduciary duties have been modified pursuant to the terms of our limited liability company agreement. Some of our directors and officers are also directors and officers of Enbridge and the General Partner and have fiduciary duties to manage the business of Enbridge or the General Partner and the Partnership in a manner beneficial to Enbridge and its shareholders or the General Partner, the Partnership and their respective shareholders or unitholders, as the case may be. Furthermore, through its ownership of our voting shares, the General Partner has the sole power to elect all of our directors. The resolution of these conflicts of interest may not always be in our best interest or in the best interest of our shareholders. SECURITY OWNERSHIP AND DISTRIBUTIONS In connection with our formation on May 14, 2002, we issued the General Partner one voting share in consideration of the General Partner s initial contribution to us.
