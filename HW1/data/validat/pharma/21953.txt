Business Overview We are an oncology company focused on the clinical development of novel therapies for cancer. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MEIP . Our business purpose is the development of drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our portfolio of drug candidates includes Pracinostat, an oral histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor being developed in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) who are 75 years of age or unfit for intensive chemotherapy and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license, development and commercialization agreement with Helsinn Healthcare SA ( Helsinn ) for Pracinostat in AML and other potential indications. Our clinical development portfolio also includes ME-401, an oral inhibitor of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) delta being developed for B-cell malignancies, and ME-344, a mitochondrial inhibitor that has shown evidence of clinical activity in refractory solid tumors. We own exclusive worldwide rights to ME-401 and ME-344. Clinical Development Programs HDAC Inhibitor Drug Candidate: Pracinostat Pracinostat is an orally available inhibitor of a group of enzymes called histone deacetylases, or HDACs. HDACs belong to a larger set of proteins collectively known as epigenetic regulators that can alter gene expression by chemically modifying deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) or its associated chromosomal proteins. Abnormal activity of these regulators is believed to play an important role in cancer and other diseases. Pracinostat has been tested in multiple Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in advanced hematologic malignancies and solid tumor indications. The results of these studies suggest that Pracinostat has potential best-in-class pharmacokinetic properties when compared to other oral HDAC inhibitors, with side effects often associated with drugs of this class, the most frequent of which are fatigue and myelosuppression. Pracinostat has demonstrated clinical evidence of single-agent activity in patients with AML and myelofibrosis. In a Phase I dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, 14% of the evaluable AML patients (two out of 14) achieved a complete remission ( CR ), with the responses enduring for more than 206 and 362 days, respectively. These results were presented at the American Society of Hematology ( ASH ) Annual Meeting in December 2010. In a Phase II clinical trial in intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, 36% of patients (eight out of 22) demonstrated a clinical response from Pracinostat treatment, with 9% of patients (two out of 22) having a clinical improvement (anemia response) and 27% (six out of 22) experiencing some reduction in splenomegaly. These results were published in the September 2012 issue of Leukemia Research . 3 Table of Contents Pracinostat has also shown evidence of synergistic activity when used in combination with the hypomethylating agent, azacitidine. Results from a pilot study in patients with advanced MDS presented at the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2012 showed an overall response rate of 89% (eight out of nine). The combination of Pracinostat and azacitidine was generally well-tolerated in the study; the most frequent side effects were nausea and fatigue. In June 2013, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical study of Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine in intermediate-2 or high-risk patients with previously untreated MDS. The study enrolled 102 evaluable patients, randomized one-to-one, at 19 sites in the U.S. In March 2015, we announced top-line data from the study, which showed that the addition of Pracinostat to azacitidine failed to improve the overall CR rate, the study s primary endpoint, compared to azacitidine alone. There were no new toxicities observed in the study; however fatigue, gastrointestinal toxicities and myelosuppression occurred more frequently in the combination group and resulted in a higher rate of drug discontinuations compared to azacitidine alone, predominantly within the first two cycles of treatment. Exploratory analysis of patients able to tolerate Pracinostat plus azacitidine for at least four cycles suggest superior activity of the combination compared to azacitidine alone, with hazard ratios for overall survival (0.59) and duration of response (0.48) both favoring the Pracinostat plus azacitidine arm. These data were presented at the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2015. In February 2014, the U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) granted orphan drug designation to Pracinostat for the treatment of AML. The designation provides orphan status to drugs defined by the FDA as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Orphan designation qualifies us for certain development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, prescription drug user fee exemptions and seven-year marketing exclusivity upon FDA approval. We also intend to seek orphan drug designation in the U.S. and Europe for Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of AML. In November 2014, we completed enrollment in our open-label Phase II study of Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML. The study enrolled a total of 50 patients at 15 clinical sites in the U.S. The median age in the study was 76 years. Patients received 60 mg of Pracinostat orally three times a week for three weeks followed by one week of rest and 75 mg/m2 of azacitidine via subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion for the first seven days of each 28-day cycle. Results from this study were presented at the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2015. According to the oral presentation by principal investigator Dr. Guillermo Garcia-Manero, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 28 of the 50 patients in the study (56%) achieved the primary endpoint of CR plus complete response with incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) plus morphologic leukemia-free state ( MLFS ), including 21 patients (42%) who achieved a CR. Notably, 19 of the 21 patients who achieved a CR were still alive with a 100% one-year survival rate among all CR patients, indicating a correlation between CR and survival with this low-intensity therapy. Median overall survival for all 50 patients in the study was reached at 19.1 months. These data compare favorably to a recent international Phase III study of azacitidine (AZA-001; Dombret H et al. Blood. 2015 May 18), which showed a median overall survival of 10.4 months with azacitidine alone and a CR rate of 19.5% in a similar patient population. Median survival among patients with high-risk cytogenetics in this study (n=21) was 13.3 months, more than double the median survival of the high-risk population in the AZA-001 study (6.4 months). The combination of Pracinostat and azacitidine was generally well tolerated in the study, with no unexpected toxicities. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events reported in 10% of all patients included febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and fatigue. In August 2016, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AML who are 75 years of age or unfit for intensive chemotherapy. In addition, agreement has been reached with the FDA on the proposed Phase III study design. According to the FDA, Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for Breakthrough Therapy Designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy Designation has all the benefits of the fast track program together with more intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program and an organizational commitment involving senior managers. In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive license, development and commercialization agreement with Helsinn, a Swiss pharmaceutical corporation, for Pracinostat in AML and other potential indications. Under the terms of the agreement, Helsinn is granted a worldwide exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pracinostat, and is responsible for funding its global development and commercialization. As compensation for such grant of rights, we will receive near-term payments of $20 million, including a $15 million upfront payment and a $5 million payment upon the earlier to occur of (i) dosing of the first patient in the upcoming Phase III study of Pracinostat in newly diagnosed AML patients unfit to receive induction therapy, or (ii) March 1, 2017. In addition, we will be eligible to receive up to $444 million in potential regulatory and sales-based milestones, along with royalty payments on the net sales of Pracinostat. As part of the license, development and commercialization agreement, we will also collaborate with Helsinn to explore an optimal dosing regimen of Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of high risk MDS. This clinical study is anticipated to commence in the first half of 2017. 4 Table of Contents PI3-Kinase Delta Drug Candidate: ME-401 In September 2013, we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to ME-401 from Pathway Therapeutics, Inc. for an undisclosed upfront cash payment with no future milestone or royalty obligations. Data from pre-clinical studies show ME-401 to be a potent and selective oral inhibitor of PI3K delta, a molecular target that plays a critical role in the proliferation and survival of certain hematologic cancer cells. ME-401 has a distinct chemical structure from certain other PI3K delta inhibitors, including idelalisib (marketed as Zydelig ). Data presented at the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2012 demonstrated that ME-401 has superior pre-clinical activity compared to idelalisib. Data from a first-in-human, single ascending dose clinical study of ME-401 in healthy subjects demonstrated on-target activity at very low plasma concentrations. In addition, the pharmacokinetic results suggest that ME-401 has the potential for a superior pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and an improved therapeutic window compared to idelalisib, with a half-life that supports once-daily dosing. These results were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research ( AACR ) Annual Meeting in April 2016. In March 2016, the FDA approved our Investigational New Drug Application ( IND ) for ME-401 in B-cell malignancies. We expect to dose the first patient in a Phase Ib dose-escalation study of ME-401 in patients with recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) or follicular non-Hodgkin s lymphoma ( fNHL ) in the third quarter of calendar year 2016. Mitochondrial Inhibitor Drug Candidate: ME-344 ME-344 is our isoflavone-derived mitochondrial inhibitor drug candidate. In preclinical studies, ME-344 has been shown to cause cell death in multiple human tumor cell lines, including ovarian cancer stem cells, by interfering with mitochondrial energy generation. Results from our first-in-human, single-agent Phase I clinical trial of ME-344 in patients with refractory solid tumors were published in the April 1, 2015 issue of Cancer . The results indicated that eight of 21 evaluable patients (38%) treated with ME-344 achieved stable disease or better, including five who experienced progression-free survival that was at least twice the duration of their last prior treatment before entry into the study. In addition, one of these patients, a heavily pre-treated patient with small cell lung cancer, achieved a confirmed partial response and remained on study for two years. ME-344 was generally well tolerated at doses equal to or less than 10 mg/kg delivered on a weekly schedule for extended durations. Treatment-related adverse events included nausea, dizziness and fatigue. Dose limiting toxicities were observed at both the 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose levels, consisting primarily of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. In May 2015, we announced new pre-clinical data from a collaboration with the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid showing mitochondria-specific effects of ME-344 in cancer cells, including substantially enhanced anti-tumor activity when combined with agents that inhibit the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ). These new data demonstrate that the anti-cancer effects when combining ME-344 with a VEGF inhibitor are due to an inhibition of both mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism. An investigator-sponsored study of ME-344 in combination with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab (marketed as Avastin ) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 )-negative breast cancer opened for enrollment in August 2016. Scientific Overview Epigenetics Program HDACs play a key role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by regulating chromatin structure. Acetylation of positively charged lysine residues present in histone proteins by the histone acetyltransferase ( HATs ) reduces the affinity between histones and negatively charged DNA, resulting in the opening of the chromatin structure. This makes it easier for the transcriptional machinery to access the DNA, enhancing RNA transcription. Conversely, deacetylation by the HDACs closes the chromatin structure leading to a repression of gene transcription. In normal cells, HDACs and HATs together control histone acetylation levels to maintain a balance. In diseases such as cancer, this regulation can be disturbed. HDAC inhibitors cause accumulation of acetylated histones, enhance transcription and result in changes of a variety of cellular responses including differentiation, proliferation, migration, survival and response to metabolic and hypoxic stress. In general, tumor cells are more susceptible than normal cells to the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of HDAC inhibitors. There are currently three HDAC inhibitors, one oral and two injectable, approved by the FDA for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma and a fourth HDAC (oral) approved for multiple myeloma. Other HDAC inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials as single agents and in combination with chemotherapy for various hematologic diseases, including AML, MDS and myelofibrosis, as well as for solid tumors. Pracinostat Pracinostat is an orally available, potent HDAC inhibitor with potentially improved physicochemical, pharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic properties when compared to other compounds of this class, including increased bioavailability and increased half-life. 5 Table of Contents Pracinostat has been tested in more than 300 patients in multiple Phase I and Phase II clinical trials and found to be generally well tolerated with manageable side effects often associated with drugs of this class, including fatigue, myelosuppresion and gastrointestinal toxicity. Results from a Phase I dose-escalation study, presented at the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2010, demonstrated clinical evidence of single-agent activity in patients with AML, including two CRs. In addition, data from a Phase II clinical trial of Pracinostat showed single-agent activity in patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis. These results were published in the September 2012 issue of Leukemia Research . Pracinostat has also shown evidence of activity when used in combination with a wide range of therapies in clinical and pre-clinical studies. Pre-clinical data published in the May 2012 issue of Blood Cancer Journal demonstrated synergistic activity when Pracinostat was combined with Pacritinib, an experimental JAK2 inhibitor. In addition to the Phase II clinical studies in AML and MDS as described under Clinical Development Programs above, Pracinostat is currently being evaluated in a Phase II study in combination with ruxolitinib (marketed as Jakafi and Jakavi ) in patients with myelofibrosis. The goal of this study is to learn if Pracinostat, when given in combination with ruxolitinib, can help to control myelofibrosis. The study, sponsored by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, began enrollment in early calendar year 2015. Signaling Program ME-401 The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is an important signaling pathway for many cellular functions such as cell survival, cell cycle progression and cellular growth. PI3Ks are a family of enzymes within this pathway that have been shown to play a critical role in the proliferation and survival of certain cancer cells. There are several isoforms of PI3K that are expressed in different types of cells. The PI3K delta isoform is believed to be important for survival of certain B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. In pre-clinical studies, ME-401 has been found to be a potent and selective oral inhibitor of PI3K delta, with a distinct chemical structure and evidence of improved pre-clinical activity compared to the approved PI3K delta-selective inhibitor, idelalisib. In March 2016, the FDA approved our IND for ME-401 in B-cell malignancies. Cancer Metabolism Program Our Company was originally formed to develop novel cancer therapeutics based on a group of compounds known as isoflavones. More than 400 new chemical structures were created based on the central design of these naturally occurring plant isoflavones. We believe that some of these synthetic compounds, including our drug candidate ME-344, interact with specific enzyme targets, resulting in the inhibition of tumor cell metabolism, a function critical for the survival of cancer cells. ME-344 ME-344 is the active metabolite of a first generation compound, named NV-128. The proposed target for NV-128 and ME-344 is found in the tumor cell mitochondria, the specialized area in the cell that produces energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ). When these compounds interact with their target, a rapid reduction in ATP occurs, which leads to a cascade of biochemical events within the cell and ultimately to cell death. One outcome that is believed to be critical for cell death induction by ME-344 is the disruption of both mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR1 and mTOR2) pathways. In cancer cells, the mTOR protein is involved in enhancing tumor growth and may be associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Inhibition of both mTOR pathways appears to shut down many of the cellular survival pathways of cancer cells. ME-344 has demonstrated broad activity against a panel of human cancer cell lines both as a single agent and as a chemosensitizing agent. Results from laboratory research studies conducted in collaboration with the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at the Yale School of Medicine demonstrate that NV-128 and ME-344 are active against chemotherapy-resistant ovarian tumor stem cells. In April 2011, at the AACR Annual Meeting, researchers from the Yale School of Medicine presented pre-clinical data demonstrating the ability of NV-128 to induce mitochondrial instability, ultimately leading to cell death in chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer stem cells. This cell death was associated with the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway leading to mitochondrial depolarization and DNA fragmentation. The study further characterized the mechanism of action of NV-128 and demonstrated that NV-128 also promotes a state of cellular starvation, resulting in the activation of the AMP kinase pathway, leading to inhibition of both mTOR pathways and the induction of destructive autophagy. In April 2013, new data were presented at the AACR Annual Meeting showing the ability of ME-344 to decrease tumor burden and delay recurrence in a pre-clinical in vivo model of recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. In a paper published in the February 2015 issue of the American Journal of Cancer Research , our collaborators at the MIMR-PHI Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne identified mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex I as a direct molecular target of ME-344, with the inhibition of this complex causing an immediate reduction of mitochondrial oxygen consumption. This finding provides new understanding of how ME-344 induces cell death by disrupting mitochondrial metabolism. To gain further insight into its mechanism of action, researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston compared the activity of ME-344 in sensitive and naturally resistant lung cancer cell lines. In a dose dependent manner, ME-344 caused instantaneous and pronounced inhibition of oxygen consumption rates in drug-sensitive lung cancer cells, but significantly less in drug-resistant cells. Drug resistance correlated with higher glycolytic metabolism in these cells. These findings were published in the August 2016 issue of The Journal Of Pharmacology And Experimental Therapeutics . 6 Table of Contents In addition, using a well-characterized spontaneous breast tumor model, researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid found that chronic treatment with the small molecule VEGFr nintedanib significantly diminished tumor cell glycolysis, however the growing tumor shifted to reliance on mitochondrial metabolism as its primary energy source. Subsequently, tumors primed by treatment with nintedanib showed substantially enhanced sensitivity to the mitochondrial inhibitor ME-344, with synergistic anti-tumor activity. These findings were published in the June 2016 issue of Cell Reports . Competition The marketplace for our drug candidates is highly competitive. A number of other companies have products or drug candidates in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development that are intended for the same therapeutic indications for which our drug candidates are being developed. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized sooner. Even if we are successful in developing effective drugs, our drug candidates may not compete successfully with products produced by our competitors. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors developing oncology drugs have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing, and marketing than we do. They compete with us in recruiting eligible patients to participate in clinical studies and in attracting development and/or commercialization partners. They also license technologies that are competitive with our technologies. As a result, our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that would render our technologies or our drug candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Intellectual Property We own, by assignment, worldwide rights to each of our current drug candidates. Our intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 17 issued U.S. patents, 130 issued foreign patents, nine pending U.S. patent applications and 39 pending foreign applications. We have acquired, by assignment, patents and patent applications from S*Bio relating to a family of heterocyclic compounds, which include Pracinostat, that inhibit histone deacetylases. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) has issued five patents covering a number of these heterocyclic-based compounds, including Pracinostat, and their composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of use to treat proliferative diseases. The composition of matter claims covering Pracinostat are projected to expire in May 2028, not including patent term extension. On August 5, 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive license, development and commercialization agreement with Helsinn. The agreement has a term (the Term ) commencing on the effective date and continuing, on a country-by-country basis, until the later of the date (i) of expiration of the applicable patents in such country, (ii) of expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country or (iii) that is 15 years after the first commercial sale in such country. With respect to certain defined Tier 2 countries, the Term is solely based on 15 years from first commercial sale. During the Term, the Company granted to Helsinn an exclusive (subject to certain retained rights to perform obligations under the agreement), sublicenseable, payment-bearing, license under and to certain patents and know-how controlled by the Company to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pracinostat and any pharmaceutical product containing Pracinostat for all human and animal indications. We have acquired, by assignment, patents and patent applications from Novogen, our former majority shareholder, which relate to a large family of isoflavonoid compounds, including ME-344. The USPTO has issued three patents covering ME-344, including its composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use to treat cancer. The composition of matter claims covering ME-344 are expected to expire in March 2027, not including patent term extension. We have acquired by assignment worldwide rights to ME-401 and other related compounds from Pathway Therapeutics, Inc. The USPTO has issued two patents covering the composition of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of ME-401 which are projected to expire in January 2031 and December 2032, not including any patent term extension. There are currently one U.S. and 19 foreign applications for ME-401 and related compounds pending. Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies, compounds and information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection for our key inventions, including drug candidates we identify, routes for chemical synthesis and pharmaceutical formulations. There is no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue, or that any of our patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant product or method. In addition, we regularly review our patent portfolio to identify patents and patent applications that we deem to have relatively low value to our ongoing business operations for potential abandonment. There is also no assurance that we will correctly identify which of our patents and patent applications should be maintained and which should be abandoned. The term of most of our other current patents commenced, and most of our future patents, if any, will commence, on the date of issuance and terminate 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. Because any marketing and regulatory approval for a drug often occurs several years after the related patent application is filed, the resulting market exclusivity afforded by any patent on our drug candidates and technologies will likely be substantially less than 20 years. 7 Table of Contents As most patent applications in the U.S. are maintained as confidential until published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at 18 months from filing for all cases filed after November 29, 2000, or at issue, for cases filed prior to November 29, 2000, we cannot be certain that we, S*Bio, Novogen or Pathway Therapeutics, Inc. were the first to make the inventions covered by the patents and applications referred to above. Additionally, publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind the actual discoveries. Moreover, pursuant to the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, patents filed on or after June 8, 1995 have a term of twenty years from the date of such filing except for provisional applications, irrespective of the period of time it may take for such patent to ultimately issue. This may shorten the period of patent protection afforded to therapeutic uses of Pracinostat, ME-401 or ME-344, as patent applications in the biopharmaceutical sector often take considerable time to issue. However, in some countries the patent term may be extended. In order to protect the confidentiality of our technology, including trade secrets and know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, we require all of our consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into agreements that prohibit the use or disclosure of information that is deemed confidential. These agreements also oblige our consultants, advisors and collaborators to assign to us, or negotiate a license to developments, discoveries and inventions made by such persons in connection with their work relating to our products. We cannot be sure that confidentiality will be maintained by those from whom we have acquired technology or disclosure prevented by these agreements. We also cannot be sure that our proprietary information or intellectual property will be protected by these agreements or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or intellectual property. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and patents may have been applied for by, and issued to, other parties relating to products competitive with Pracinostat, ME-401 or ME-344. Use of these compounds and any other drug candidates may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties, existing now and in the future. An adverse claim could subject us to significant liabilities to such other parties and/or require disputed rights to be licensed from such other parties. We cannot be sure that any license required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we may encounter delays in product market introductions, or may find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses may be precluded. Research and Development The objective of our research and development program is the generation of data sufficient to achieve regulatory approval of our drug candidates in one or more dosage forms in major markets such as the U.S., to develop commercially attractive attributes, and/or to allow us to enter into a development and/or commercial relationship with another party. The data are generated by our pre-clinical studies and clinical trial programs. The key aspects of our research and development program are to provide more complete characterization of the following: the relevant molecular targets of action of our drug candidates; the relative therapeutic benefits and indications for use of our drug candidates as a monotherapy or as part of combinational therapy with other agents; the most appropriate therapeutic indications and dosage forms for Pracinostat, ME-401 and ME-344. Our research and development expenses include clinical and preclinical study fees, personnel costs, and manufacturing costs. Research and development expenses were $13.4 million, $23.8 million, and $19.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Government Regulation U.S. Regulatory Requirements The FDA, and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries, regulate and impose substantial requirements upon the research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, labeling, manufacture, quality control, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution and export of pharmaceutical products including biologics, as well as significant reporting and record-keeping obligations. State governments may also impose obligations in these areas. In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA ) and other laws, including in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. We believe, but cannot be certain, that our products will be regulated as drugs by the FDA. The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: pre-clinical laboratory evaluations, including formulation and stability testing, and animal tests performed under the FDA s Good Laboratory Practices regulations to assess pharmacological activity and toxicity potential; submission and approval of an IND, including results of pre-clinical tests, manufacturing information, and protocols for clinical tests, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin in the U.S.; obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards ( IRB ), to administer the products to human subjects in clinical trials; adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for the product s intended use; development of manufacturing processes which conform to FDA current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMP ), as confirmed by FDA inspection; 8 Table of Contents submission of results for pre-clinical and clinical studies, and chemistry, manufacture and control information on the product to the FDA in a New Drug Approval Application ( NDA and FDA review and approval of a NDA, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of a product. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The results of the pre-clinical studies, together with initial specified manufacturing information, the proposed clinical trial protocol, and information about the participating investigators are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we may begin human clinical trials in the U.S. Additionally, an independent IRB must review and approve each study protocol and oversee conduct of the trial. An IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, the IND sponsor must resolve the FDA s concerns before clinical trials can begin. Pre-clinical tests and studies can take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND we submit based on such tests and studies will become effective within any specific time period, if at all. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. Phase I: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety and dosage tolerance. Absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion testing is generally performed at this stage. Phase II: The drug is studied in controlled, exploratory therapeutic trials in a limited number of subjects with the disease or medical condition for which the new drug is intended to be used in order to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the preliminary or potential efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or medical conditions, and to determine dosage tolerance and the optimal effective dose. Phase III: When Phase II studies demonstrate that a specific dosage range of the drug is likely to be effective and the drug has an acceptable safety profile, controlled, large-scale therapeutic Phase III trials are undertaken at multiple study sites to demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population. We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete clinical testing of our products within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRB or we may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as detailed information about the manufacturing process, quality control methods, and product composition, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA seeking approval to market and commercially distribute the product on the basis of a determination that the product is safe and effective for its intended use. Before approving a NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, the FDA may deny the NDA or require additional testing or information. As a condition of approval, the FDA also may require post-marketing testing or surveillance to monitor the product s safety or efficacy. Even after a NDA is approved, the FDA may impose additional obligations or restrictions (such as labeling changes, or clinical post-marketing requirements), or even suspend or withdraw a product approval on the basis of data that arise after the product reaches the market, or if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained. We cannot be certain that any NDA we submit will be approved by the FDA on a timely basis, if at all. Also, any such approval may limit the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. Any refusal to approve, delay in approval, suspension or withdrawal of approval, or restrictions on indicated uses could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects. Each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee, pursuant to the requirements of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ( PDUFA ), and its amendments. According to the FDA s fee schedule, effective on October 1, 2015 the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a NDA, is $2,374,200. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for prescription drugs and biologics ($114,450), and an annual establishment fee ($585,200) on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs and biologics. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Effective on October 1, 2016, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a NDA, will decrease to $2,038,100, the annual product fee for prescription drugs and biologics will decrease to $97,750, and the annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs and biologics will increase to $512,200. A written request can be submitted for a waiver for the application fee for the first human drug application that is filed by a small business, but there are no waivers for product or establishment fees. We are not at the stage of development with our products where we are subject to these fees, but they are significant expenditures that may be incurred in the future and must be paid at the time of application submissions to the FDA. Satisfaction of FDA requirements typically takes several years. The actual time required varies substantially, based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the pharmaceutical product, among other things. Government regulation imposes costly and time-consuming requirements and restrictions throughout the product life cycle and may delay product marketing for a considerable period of time, limit product marketing, or prevent marketing altogether. Success in pre-clinical or early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent marketing approval. Even if a product receives marketing approval, the approval is limited to specific clinical indications. Further, even after marketing approval is obtained, the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. 9 Table of Contents After product approval, there are continuing significant regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements, obligations to report adverse side effects in patients using the products, and restrictions on advertising and promotional activities. Quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs, and the FDA periodically inspects facilities to assess cGMP compliance. Additionally, post-approval changes in ingredient composition, manufacturing processes or facilities, product labeling, or other areas may require submission of a NDA Supplement to the FDA for review and approval. New indications will require additional clinical studies and submission of a NDA Supplement. Failure to comply with FDA regulatory requirements may result in an enforcement action by the FDA, including Warning Letters, product recalls, suspension or revocation of product approval, seizure of product to prevent distribution, impositions of injunctions prohibiting product manufacture or distribution, and civil and criminal penalties. Maintaining compliance is costly and time-consuming. We cannot be certain that we, or our present or future suppliers or third-party manufacturers, will be able to comply with all FDA regulatory requirements, and potential consequences of noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects. The FDA s policies may change, and additional governmental regulations may be enacted that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval of our products or affect our ability to manufacture, market, or distribute our products after approval. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of healthcare costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to commercialize future products will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other third-party payers. European Union member states and U.S. government and other third-party payers increasingly are attempting to contain healthcare costs by consideration of new laws and regulations limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs. Our failure to obtain coverage, an adequate level of reimbursement, or acceptable prices for our future products could diminish any revenues we may be able to generate. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. Our activities also may be subject to state laws and regulations that affect our ability to develop and sell our products. We are also subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, clinical, laboratory, and manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future, and the failure to comply may have a material adverse impact on our business prospects. The FDCA includes provisions designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs and biological products intended for treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such conditions. These provisions set forth a procedure for designation of a drug as a fast track product . The fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and specific indication for which it is being studied. A product designated as fast track is ordinarily eligible for additional programs for expediting development and review, but products that are not in fast track drug development programs may also be able to take advantage of these programs. These programs include priority review of NDAs and accelerated approval. Drug approval under the accelerated approval regulations may be based on evidence of clinical effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. A post-marketing clinical study will be required to verify clinical benefit, and other restrictions to assure safe use may be imposed. We do not currently have fast track designation for any of our clinical programs. If we should seek such designation for any of our programs, however, we cannot be assured that it will be granted by the FDA. Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, a sponsor may obtain marketing exclusivity for a period of time following FDA approval of certain drug applications, regardless of patent status, if the drug is a new chemical entity or if new clinical studies were required to support the marketing application for the drug. This marketing exclusivity prevents a third party from obtaining FDA approval for an identical or nearly identical drug under an Abbreviated New Drug Application or a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application . The statute also allows a patent owner to obtain an extension of applicable patent terms for a period equal to one-half the period of time elapsed between the filing of an IND and the filing of the corresponding NDA plus the period of time between the filing of the NDA and FDA approval, with a five year maximum patent extension. We cannot be certain that we will be able to take advantage of either the patent term extension or marketing exclusivity provisions of these laws. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act ( BPCA ), signed into law on January 4, 2002, was reauthorized and amended by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 ( FDAAA ). The reauthorization of BPCA provides an additional six months of patent protection to NDA applicants that conduct acceptable pediatric studies of new and currently-marketed drug products for which pediatric information would be beneficial, as identified by the FDA in a Pediatric Written Request. The Pediatric Research Equity Act ( PREA ), signed into law on December 3, 2003, also was reauthorized and amended by the FDAAA. The reauthorization of PREA requires that most applications for drugs and biologics include a pediatric assessment (unless waived or deferred) to ensure the drugs and biologics safety and effectiveness in children. Such pediatric assessment must contain data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or the biological product is safe and effective. The pediatric assessments can only be deferred provided there is a timeline for the completion of such studies. The FDA may waive (partially or fully) the pediatric assessment requirement for several reasons, including if the applicant can demonstrate that reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act signed into law on July 9, 2012, permanently renewed and strengthened BPCA and PREA. 10 Table of Contents Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances. Pracinostat has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of AML, but it may not receive orphan designation for other indications. We also intend to seek orphan drug designation in the U.S. and Europe for Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of AML. Our other products may not be eligible for orphan drug status or be designated as orphan drugs. Even if designated as orphan drugs, our products may not be approved before other applications or granted orphan drug exclusivity if approved. Foreign Regulatory Requirements Outside the U.S., our ability to market our products will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities and compliance with applicable post-approval regulatory requirements. Although the specific requirements and restrictions vary from country to country, as a general matter, foreign regulatory systems include risks similar to those associated with FDA regulation, described above. Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or a national procedure. Under the centralized procedure, a single application to the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) leads to an approval granted by the European Commission which permits the marketing of the product throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain classes of medicinal products, but optional for others. For example, all medicinal products developed by certain biotechnological means, and those developed for cancer and other specified diseases and disorders, must be authorized via the centralized procedure. We assume that the centralized procedure will apply to our products that are developed by means of a biotechnology process or are intended for treatment of cancer. The national procedure is used for products that are not required to be authorized by the centralized procedure. Under the national procedure, an application for a marketing authorization is submitted to the competent authority of one member state of the EU. The holders of a national marketing authorization may submit further applications to the competent authorities of the remaining member states via either the decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. The decentralized procedure enables applicants to submit an identical application to the competent authorities of all member states where approval is sought at the same time as the first application, while under the mutual recognition procedure, products are authorized initially in one member state, and other member states where approval is sought are then requested to recognize the original authorization based upon an assessment report prepared by the original authorizing competent authority. Both the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures should take no longer than 90 days, but if one member state makes an objection, which under the legislation can only be based on a possible risk to human health, the application will be automatically referred to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) of the EMA. If a referral for arbitration is made, the procedure is suspended. However, member states that have already approved the application may, at the request of the applicant, authorize the product in question without waiting for the result of the arbitration. Such authorizations will be without prejudice to the outcome of the arbitration. For all other concerned member states, the opinion of the CHMP, which is binding, could support or reject the objection or alternatively could reach a compromise position acceptable to all EU countries concerned. The arbitration procedure may take an additional year before a final decision is reached and may require the delivery of additional data. As with FDA approval, we may not be able to secure regulatory approvals in Europe in a timely manner, if at all. Additionally, as in the U.S., post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution, would apply to any product that is approved in Europe, and failure to comply with such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize any product. The conduct of clinical trials in the European Union is governed by the European Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC), which was implemented in May 2004. This Directive governs how regulatory bodies in member states control clinical trials. No clinical trial may be started without a clinical trial authorization granted by the national competent authority and favorable ethics approval. New legislation to revise and replace the European Clinical Trials Directive is currently proposed by the European Commission and is under consideration by European Union institutions. Accordingly, there is a marked degree of change and uncertainty both in the regulation of clinical trials and in respect of marketing authorizations which we face for our products in Europe. Manufacturing We do not have the facilities or capabilities to commercially manufacture any of our products and product candidates. We are and expect to continue to be dependent on contract manufacturers for supplying our existing and future product candidates for clinical trials and commercial scale manufacturing of our product candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements, including current Good Manufacturing Practices. Contract manufacturers may utilize their own technology, technology developed by us, or technology acquired or licensed from third parties. FDA approval of the manufacturing procedures and the site will be required prior to commercial distribution. 11 Table of Contents Employees As of June 30, 2016, we had 23 employees, seven of whom hold a Ph.D. or M.D. degree. Other personnel resources are used from time to time as consultants or third party service organizations on an as-needed basis. All members of our senior management team have prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced personnel, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the individuals needed. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced work stoppages. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. Available Information Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge through our website at www.meipharma.com as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. °Item 1A. Risk Factors Investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks described below, together with other information in this Annual Report and other public filings, before making investment decisions regarding our securities. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Moreover, the risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business We will need substantial additional funds to progress the clinical trial program for our drug candidates, and to develop new compounds. The actual amount of funds we will need will be determined by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. We will need substantial additional funds to progress the clinical trial program for our drug candidates and to develop any additional compounds. The factors which will determine the actual amount of funds that we will need to progress the clinical trial programs may include, but are not limited to, the following: the therapeutic indications for use being developed; the clinical trial endpoint required to achieve regulatory approval; the number of clinical trials required to achieve regulatory approval; the number of sites included in the trials; the length of time required to enroll suitable patients; the number of patients who participate in the trials and the rate that they are recruited; the number of treatment cycles patients complete while they are enrolled in the trials; and the efficacy and safety profile of the product. We have been opportunistic in our efforts to obtain cash, and we expect to continue to evaluate various funding alternatives from time to time. If we obtain additional funding, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all, we may be required to cease or reduce our operations. We may sell additional shares of common stock, and securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock, to satisfy our capital and operating needs; however, such transactions will be subject to market conditions and there can be no assurance any such transactions will be completed. If Helsinn does not satisfy its obligations under our collaboration agreement or if they terminate the collaboration agreement, we may not be able to develop or commercialize Pracinostat. In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive license, development and commercialization agreement with Helsinn to collaborate on the global development, manufacturing and commercialization of Pracinostat. In connection with this agreement, we granted to Helsinn certain rights regarding the use of our patents and technology with respect to Pracinostat. Helsinn will be primarily responsible for the global development of Pracinostat and, subject to certain exceptions, will be solely responsible for all costs related thereto, and will also be solely responsible for the global commercialization of Pracinostat and shall be solely responsible for the costs related thereto. We may earn up to $444 million in potential regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, plus royalties on global net sales of Pracinostat, which, in the U.S., are tiered and begin in the mid-teens. Helsinn might not fulfill all of its obligations under the agreement. Our ability to receive revenue from Pracinostat is dependent upon Helsinn s efforts. If Helsinn fails to devote adequate resources or otherwise does not successfully develop and commercialize Pracinostat, we may not receive the future milestone payments or royalties provided for in the agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances, including our failure to satisfy our obligations under the agreement, Helsinn has the right to terminate the agreement. 12 Table of Contents We could also become involved in disputes with Helsinn, which could lead to delays in or termination of the agreement and time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration. If Helsinn is unwilling or unable to fulfill its obligations or if the agreement is terminated, we may lack sufficient resources to develop and commercialize Pracinostat on our own and may be unable to reach agreement with a suitable alternative collaborator. The failure to develop and commercialize Pracinostat would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. Negative U.S. and global economic conditions may pose challenges to our business strategy, which relies on funding from the financial markets or collaborators. Negative conditions in the U.S. or global economy, including financial markets, may adversely affect our business and the business of current and prospective vendors, licensees and collaborators, and others with whom we do or may conduct business. The duration and severity of these conditions is uncertain. If negative economic conditions occur, we may be unable to secure funding to sustain our operations or to find suitable collaborators to advance our internal programs, even if we achieve positive results from our drug development programs. We are a clinical research and development stage company and are likely to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. You should consider our prospects in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by clinical research stage and developmental companies. We were incorporated in December 2000, and have been in operation since May 2002. We have incurred net losses of $177.0 million from our inception through June 30, 2016, including net losses of $20.9 million, $32.7 million and $27.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We anticipate that we will incur operating losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future. We have not yet commercialized any drug candidates and cannot be sure that we will ever be able to do so, or that we may ever become profitable. The results of pre-clinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our current drug candidates may not have favorable results in later studies or trials. Pre-clinical studies and Phase I and Phase II clinical trials are an expensive and uncertain process that may take years to complete. Pre-clinical studies and Phase I and Phase II clinical trials are not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a drug candidate, but rather to test safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and to understand the drug candidate s side effects at various doses and schedules. Favorable results in early studies or trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials, including ongoing pre-clinical studies and large-scale Phase III clinical trials, and our drug candidates in later-stage trials may fail to show desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through earlier-stage trials. Unfavorable results from ongoing pre-clinical studies or clinical trials could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials, or abandonment of a clinical program. Pre-clinical and clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals or commercialization. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be delayed, repeated or terminated, or a clinical program to be abandoned. Final approval by regulatory authorities of our drug candidates for commercial use may be delayed, limited or prevented, any of which would adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues. We will not generate any operating revenue until we successfully license or commercialize one of our drug candidates. Currently, we have drug candidates at different stages of development, and each will need to successfully complete a number of studies and obtain regulatory approval before potential commercialization. The preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, export, marketing and distribution, and other possible activities relating to our drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions that may negatively impact the approval of one or more of our drug candidates or otherwise negatively impact our business. Neither collaborators, licensees nor we are permitted to market a drug candidate in the United States until the particular drug candidate is approved for marketing by the FDA. Specific preclinical data, chemistry, manufacturing and controls data, a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, and clinical trials may commence only after the IND application becomes effective. To market a new drug in the United States, we must submit to the FDA and obtain FDA approval of an NDA. An NDA must be supported by extensive clinical and preclinical data, as well as extensive information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug candidate. Obtaining approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. Regulatory approval of an NDA is not guaranteed. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. Despite the time and expense exerted in preclinical and clinical studies, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons, including but not limited to, the following: a drug candidate may not be deemed adequately safe or effective; 13 Table of Contents FDA officials may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient; the FDA s interpretation and our interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may differ significantly; our or our contractors or collaborators failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements, including those identified in other risk factors; the FDA may not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities; the FDA may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations; or the FDA may not accept an NDA or other submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission. Our preclinical and clinical data, other information and procedures relating to a drug candidate may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or any other U.S. or foreign regulatory authority, or regulatory interpretation of these data and procedures may be unfavorable. Our business and reputation may be harmed by any failure or significant delay in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any drugs resulting from our drug candidates. As a result, we cannot predict when or whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any drug we develop. Additionally, any of the following factors may serve to delay, limit or prevent the final approval by regulatory authorities of our drug candidates for commercial use, including, but not limited to: Pracinostat, ME-401, and ME-344 are in various stages of development, and we or our licensees will need to conduct significant clinical testing to demonstrate safety and efficacy of these drug candidates before applications for marketing can be filed with the FDA, or with the regulatory authorities of other countries; development and testing of product formulation, including identification of suitable excipients, or chemical additives intended to facilitate delivery of our drug candidates; it may take us many years to complete the testing of our drug candidates, and failure can occur at any stage of this process; and negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate our development efforts. The successful development of any of these drug candidates is uncertain and, accordingly, we may never commercialize any of these drug candidates or generate significant revenue. Even if we or our licensees receive regulatory approval to commercialize our drug candidates, our ability to generate revenues from any resulting products will be subject to a variety of risks, many of which are out of our control. Even if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approval, resulting products may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from such products will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: timing of market introduction of our drugs and competitive drugs; actual and perceived efficacy and safety of our drug candidates; prevalence and severity of any side effects; potential or perceived advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments; strength of sales, marketing and distribution support; price of our future products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments; the effect of current and future healthcare laws on our drug candidates; and availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. If any of our drugs are approved and fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue to achieve or sustain profitability. We may not be able to establish the contractual arrangements necessary to develop, market and distribute our product candidates. A key part of our business plan is to establish contractual relationships with third parties to package, market and distribute our product candidates. There is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate commercially acceptable licensing or other agreements for the future exploitation of our drug product candidates, including continued clinical development, manufacture or marketing. If we are unable to successfully contract for these services, or if arrangements for these services are terminated, we may have to delay our commercialization program which will adversely affect our ability to generate operating revenues. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and market products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our drug candidates. The development of drug candidates is highly competitive. A number of other companies have products or drug candidates that have either been approved or are in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development that are intended for the same therapeutic indications for which our drug candidates are being developed. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized sooner. Even if we are successful in developing effective drugs, our compounds may not compete successfully with products produced by our competitors. 14 Table of Contents Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors developing oncology drugs have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us and our service providers, to recruit qualified personnel, and with us to attract partners for joint ventures and to license technologies that are competitive with us. As a result, our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that would render our technologies or our drug candidates obsolete or non-competitive. We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our pre-clinical studies. If those parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our drug candidates may not advance in a timely manner or at all. In the course of our pre-clinical testing and clinical trials, we rely on third parties, including laboratories, investigators, clinical contract research organizations ( CROs ), and manufacturers, to perform critical services for us. For example, we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our pre-clinical studies. CROs are responsible for many aspects of the trials, including finding and enrolling subjects for testing and administering the trials. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. These third parties may not be available when we need them or, if they are available, may not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or may not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner, and we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. These independent third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. In addition, if such third parties fail to perform their obligations in compliance with our clinical trial protocols or GCPs, our clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements or may need to be repeated. As a result of our dependence on third parties, we may face delays or failures outside of our direct control. These risks also apply to the development activities of collaborators, and we do not control their research and development, clinical trial or regulatory activities. We have no direct control over the cost of manufacturing our drug candidates. Increases in the cost of manufacturing our drug candidates would increase our costs of conducting clinical trials and could adversely affect our future profitability. We do not intend to manufacture our drug product candidates ourselves, and we will rely on third parties for our drug supplies both for clinical trials and for commercial quantities in the future. We have taken the strategic decision not to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients ( API ) for our drug candidates, as these can be more economically supplied by third parties with particular expertise in this area. We have identified contract facilities that are registered with the FDA, have a track record of large scale API manufacture, and have already invested in capital and equipment. We have no direct control over the cost of manufacturing our product candidates. If the cost of manufacturing increases, or if the cost of the materials used increases, these costs will be passed on to us, making the cost of conducting clinical trials more expensive. Increases in manufacturing costs could adversely affect our future profitability if we are unable to pass all of the increased costs along to our customers. We also rely on the contract manufacturers to comply with FDA regulatory requirements for good manufacturing practices. We rely on acquisitions or licenses from third parties to expand our pipeline of drug candidates. We are not presently engaged in drug discovery activities. In order to expand our pipeline of drug candidates for future development, we may need to purchase or in-license any such drug candidates. However, we may not be able to purchase or in-license future drug candidates from third parties on favorable terms, or at all. We face a risk of product liability claims and claims may exceed our insurance limits. Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. This risk is inherent in the manufacturing, testing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Our product liability insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate protection against potential liabilities, or claims may exceed our insurance limits. If we cannot or do not sufficiently insure against potential product liability claims, we may be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business development and commercialization efforts. Our efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to retain and attract key employees. Our success depends on the continued contributions of our principal management, development and scientific personnel. We face competition for such personnel, and we believe that risks and uncertainties related to our business, including the timing and risk associated with research and development, our available and anticipated cash resources, and the volatility of our stock price, may impact our ability to hire and retain key and other personnel. The loss of services of our Chief Executive Officer or other key employees could adversely impact our operations and ability to generate or raise additional capital. 15 Table of Contents Laws, rules and regulations relating to public companies may be costly and impact our ability to attract and retain directors and executive officers. Laws and regulations affecting public companies, including rules adopted by the SEC and by Nasdaq, may result in increased costs to us. These laws, rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees or as executive officers. We cannot estimate accurately the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these laws, rules and regulations. Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property Our commercial success is dependent, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and preserving trade secrets, which cannot be guaranteed. Patent protection and trade secret protection are important to our business and our future will depend, in part on our ability to maintain trade secret protection, obtain patents and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others both in the United States and abroad. Litigation or other legal proceedings may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s attention. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In August 2012, we acquired patents and patent applications related to Pracinostat from S*Bio. In September 2013, we acquired patents and patent applications related to ME-401 from Pathway Therapeutics, Inc. Additionally, prior to the Isoflavone Transaction, Novogen had applied for patents in a number of countries with respect to the use of their isoflavone compounds, including ME-344. We acquired both issued patents and pending patent applications from Novogen in relation to our Isoflavone-based compounds, which we previously licensed from Novogen. The patent applications may not proceed to grant or may be amended to reduce the scope of protection of any patent granted. The applications and patents may also be opposed or challenged by third parties. Our commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain effective patent protection for our compounds and their use in treating, preventing, or curing cancer, and to successfully defend patent rights in those technologies against third-party challenges. As patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until published or issued and as publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we, S*Bio, Novogen, or Pathway Therapeutics, Inc. were the first to make the inventions covered by the pending patent applications or issued patents referred to above or that we or they were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Additionally, the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents or their enforceability cannot be predicted. We cannot be sure that, should any patents issue, we will be provided with adequate protection against potentially competitive products. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that should patents issue, they will be of commercial value to us, or that private parties, including competitors, will not successfully challenge our patents or circumvent our patent position in the United States or abroad. Claims by other companies that we infringe on their proprietary technology may result in liability for damages or stop our development and commercialization efforts. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and patents have been applied for by, and issued to, other parties relating to products competitive with the compounds that we have acquired. Therefore, Pracinostat, ME-401 and ME-344 and any other drug candidates may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties existing now and in the future. Furthermore, to the extent that we or our consultants or research collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in work performed for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in such intellectual property or in resulting know-how and inventions. An adverse claim could subject us to significant liabilities to such other parties and/or require disputed rights to be licensed from such other parties. We have contracted formulation development and manufacturing process development work for our product candidates. This process has identified a number of excipients, or additives to improve drug delivery, which may be used in the formulations. Excipients, among other things, perform the function of a carrier of the active drug ingredient. Some of these identified excipients or carriers may be included in third party patents in some countries. We intend to seek a license if we decide to use a patented excipient in the marketed product or we may choose one of those excipients that does not have a license requirement. We cannot be sure that any license required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we may encounter delays in product market introductions, or may find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses may be precluded. We may be subject to substantial costs stemming from our defense against third-party intellectual property infringement claims. Third parties may assert that we are using their proprietary information without authorization. Third parties may also have or obtain patents and may claim that technologies licensed to or used by us infringe their patents. If we are required to defend patent infringement actions brought by third parties, or if we sue to protect our own patent rights, we may be required to pay substantial litigation costs and managerial attention may be diverted from business operations even if the outcome is not adverse to us. In addition, any legal action that seeks damages or an injunction to stop us from carrying on our commercial activities relating to the affected technologies could subject us to monetary liability and require us or any third party licensors to obtain a license to continue to use the affected technologies. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any of these types of actions or that any required license would be made available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. 16 Table of Contents Risks Related to Securities Markets and Investment in Our Stock The trading price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could decline in value and we may incur significant costs from class action litigation. The trading price of our common stock could be highly volatile in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following: failure to successfully develop our drug candidates; design, results and timing of clinical trials and preclinical studies; announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors; new products introduced or announced by us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; actual or anticipated variations in operating results; expiration or termination of licenses, research contracts or other collaboration agreements; conditions or trends in the regulatory climate and the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and genomics industries; instability in the stock market as a result of current or future domestic and global events; changes in the market valuations of similar companies; the liquidity of any market for our securities; and threatened or actual delisting of our common stock from a national stock exchange. Equity markets in general, and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies traded in those markets. In addition, changes in economic conditions in the U.S., Europe or globally, particularly in the context of current global events, could impact upon our ability to grow profitably. Adverse economic changes are outside our control and may result in material adverse impacts on our business or our results of operations. These broad market and industry factors may materially affect the market price of shares of our common stock, regardless of our development and operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources. Future sales of our common stock, including common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding warrants or options, may depress the market price of our common stock and cause stockholders to experience dilution. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including upon exercise of outstanding warrants or stock options, or upon issuance of shares related to restricted stock units, and any subsequent sales of such shares. As of June 30, 2016, we had outstanding (i) warrants issued in our December 2012 private placement exercisable to purchase 3,230,202 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.12 per share, which expire in December 2017; (ii) warrants issued in our May 2012 rights offering exercisable to purchase 315,484 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.14, which expire in May 2017; and (iii) Series A warrants issued in our May 2011 private placement exercisable to purchase 215,721 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00, which expire in November 2016. We also had outstanding options to purchase 2,827,172 shares of common stock and restricted stock units representing the right to receive 763,014 shares of common stock. We may seek additional capital through one or more additional equity transactions in the future; however, such transactions will be subject to market conditions and there can be no assurance any such transactions will be completed. If we sell shares in the future, the prices at which we sell these future shares will vary, and these variations may be significant. Stockholders will experience significant dilution if we sell these future shares at prices significantly below the price at which previous stockholders invested. Because we do not intend to pay, and have not paid, any cash dividends on our shares of common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless the value of our common stock appreciates and they sell their shares. We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their investment unless the value of our common stock appreciates and they sell their shares. We will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from any exercise of outstanding warrants and options. We will have broad discretion to use the net proceeds to us upon any exercise of outstanding warrants and options, and investors in our stock will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors and management regarding the application of these proceeds. Although we expect to use a substantial portion of the net proceeds from any exercise of the warrants and options for general corporate purposes and progression of our clinical trial programs, we have not allocated these net proceeds for specific purposes. 17 Table of Contents We are authorized to issue blank check preferred stock, which could adversely affect the holders of our common stock. Our restated certificate of incorporation allows us to issue blank check preferred stock with rights potentially senior to those of our common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock. The issuance of a class of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of our common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of such holders. In certain circumstances, such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our shares, or making a change in control of the Company more difficult. Our executive officers and directors may sell shares of their stock, and these sales could adversely affect our stock price. Sales of our stock by our executive officers and directors, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Our executive officers and directors may sell stock in the future, either as part, or outside, of trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. °Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. °Item 2. Properties We have leased approximately 8,800 square feet of office space, located at 11975 El Camino Real, Suite 101, San Diego, California 92130.

The Company s former wholly-owned subsidiary, Marshall Edwards Pty Ltd ( MEPL ), was legally dissolved in April 2012. As MEPL was the Company s only subsidiary, the financial statements as of and for the year ended, June 30, 2013 are no longer consolidated. In December 2012, the Company effected a 1-for-6 reverse stock split (the 2012 Reverse Stock Split ) of the Company s common stock. As a result of the 2012 Reverse Stock Split, every six shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one share of common stock. The 2012 Reverse Stock Split did not change the number of authorized shares of the Company s common stock, nor the common stock par value. All financial data and share information is presented on an as-adjusted basis to give effect to the 2012 Reverse Stock Split. 20 Table of Contents Years Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 (In thousands, except share and per share data) Statement of Operations Data: Operating expenses Research and development $ (13,403 ) $ (23,823 ) $ (19,331 ) $ (6,084 ) $ (4,915 ) General and administrative (7,601 ) (8,948 ) (7,897 ) (5,138 ) (3,479 ) Total operating expenses (21,004 ) (32,771 ) (27,228 ) (11,222 ) (8,394 ) Loss from operations (21,004 ) (32,771 ) (27,228 ) (11,222 ) (8,394 ) Other income, net 142 77 80 36 871 Net loss $ (20,862 ) $ (32,694 ) $ (27,148 ) $ (11,186 ) $ (7,523 ) Net loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.61 ) $ (1.16 ) $ (1.35 ) $ (1.10 ) $ (3.35 ) Shares used to calculate net loss per share, basic and diluted 34,400,441 28,204,356 20,061,387 10,160,835 2,247,709 As of June 30, 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 (In thousands) Balance Sheet Data: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 45,918 $ 63,779 $ 48,793 $ 35,573 $ 6,202 Total assets 47,164 64,750 49,808 36,547 6,373 Total liabilities 5,512 4,959 4,616 1,675 1,774 Accumulated deficit (177,001 ) (156,139 ) (123,445 ) (96,297 ) (85,111 ) Total stockholders equity 41,652 59,791 45,192 34,872 4,599 °Item 7.

Overview and Recent Developments Our business purpose is the development of drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our portfolio of clinical drug candidates includes Pracinostat, an oral HDAC inhibitor being developed in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AML who are 75 years of age or unfit for intensive chemotherapy and high-risk MDS. In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license, development and commercialization agreement with Helsinn for Pracinostat in AML and other potential indications. Our clinical development portfolio also includes ME-401, an oral inhibitor of PI3K delta being developed for B-cell malignancies, and ME-344, a mitochondrial inhibitor that has shown evidence of clinical activity in refractory solid tumors. We own exclusive worldwide rights to ME-401 and ME-344. We have an accumulated deficit of $177.0 million as of June 30, 2016, and may incur substantial net losses in the future as we advance our research and development programs. We have not generated any revenues from operations since inception and we expect to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. We may need additional financing to fund our operations in the future, including the continued development of our lead drug candidates. Clinical Development Programs Pracinostat In June 2013, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical study of Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine in intermediate-2 or high-risk patients with previously untreated MDS. The study enrolled 102 evaluable patients, randomized one-to-one, at 19 sites in the U.S. In March 2015, we announced top-line data from the study, which showed that the addition of Pracinostat to azacitidine failed to improve the overall CR rate, the study s primary endpoint, compared to azacitidine alone. There were no new toxicities observed in the study; however fatigue, gastrointestinal toxicities and myelosuppression occurred more frequently in the combination group and resulted in a higher rate of drug discontinuations compared to azacitidine alone, predominantly within the first two cycles of treatment. Exploratory analyses of patients able to tolerate Pracinostat plus azacitidine for at least four cycles suggest superior activity of the combination compared to azacitidine alone, with hazard ratios for overall survival (0.59) and duration of response (0.48) both favoring the Pracinostat plus azacitidine arm. These data were presented at the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2015. 21 Table of Contents In February 2014, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to Pracinostat for the treatment of AML. The designation provides orphan status to drugs defined by the FDA as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Orphan designation qualifies us for certain development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, prescription drug user fee exemptions and seven-year marketing exclusivity upon FDA approval. We also intend to seek orphan drug designation in the U.S. and Europe for Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of AML. In November 2014, we completed enrollment in our open-label Phase II study of Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML. The study enrolled a total of 50 patients at 15 clinical sites in the U.S. The median age in the study was 76 years. Patients received 60 mg of Pracinostat orally three times a week for three weeks followed by one week of rest and 75 mg/m2 of azacitidine via subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion for the first seven days of each 28-day cycle. Results from this study were presented at the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2015. According to the oral presentation by principal investigator Dr. Guillermo Garcia-Manero, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 28 of the 50 patients in the study (56%) achieved the primary endpoint of CR plus CRi plus morphologic leukemia-free state, including 21 patients (42%) who achieved a CR. Notably, 19 of the 21 patients who achieved a CR were still alive with a 100% one-year survival rate among all CR patients, indicating a correlation between CR and survival with this low-intensity therapy. The combination of Pracinostat and azacitidine was generally well tolerated in the study, with no unexpected toxicities. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events reported in 10% of all patients included febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and fatigue. Median overall survival for all 50 patients in the study has now been reached at 19.1 months. These data compare favorably to a recent international Phase III study of azacitidine (AZA-001; Dombret H et al. Blood. 2015 May 18), which showed a median overall survival of 10.4 months with azacitidine alone and a CR rate of 19.5% in a similar patient population. Median survival among patients with high-risk cytogenetics in this study (n=21) was 13.3 months, more than double the median survival of the high-risk population in the AZA-001 study (6.4 months). In August 2016, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are 75 years of age or unfit for intensive chemotherapy. In addition, agreement has been reached with the FDA on the proposed Phase III study design. According to the FDA, Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for Breakthrough Therapy Designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy Designation has all the benefits of the fast track program together with more intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program and an organizational commitment involving senior managers. In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive license, development and commercialization agreement with Helsinn, a Swiss pharmaceutical corporation, for Pracinostat in AML and other potential indications. Under the terms of the agreement, Helsinn is granted a worldwide exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pracinostat, and is responsible for funding its global development and commercialization. As compensation for such grant of rights, we will receive near-term payments of $20 million, including a $15 million upfront payment and a $5 million payment upon the earlier to occur of (i) dosing of the first patient in the upcoming Phase III study of Pracinostat in newly diagnosed AML patients unfit to receive induction therapy, or (ii) March 1, 2017. In addition, we will be eligible to receive up to $444 million in potential regulatory and sales-based milestones, along with royalty payments on the net sales of Pracinostat. As part of the license, development and commercialization agreement, we will also collaborate with Helsinn to explore an optimal dosing regimen of Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of high risk MDS. This clinical study is anticipated to commence in the first half of 2017. ME-401 Data from a first-in-human, single ascending dose clinical study of ME-401 in healthy subjects demonstrated on target activity at very low plasma concentrations. In addition, the pharmacokinetic results suggest that ME-401 has the potential for a superior pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profile and an improved therapeutic window compared to idelalisib, with a half-life that supports once-daily dosing. These results were presented at the AACR Annual Meeting in April 2016. We expect to dose the first patient in a Phase Ib dose-escalation study of ME-401 in patients with recurrent CLL or fNHL in the third quarter of calendar year 2016. ME-344 Results from our first-in-human, single-agent Phase I clinical trial of ME-344 in patients with refractory solid tumors were published in the April 1, 2015 issue of Cancer . The results indicated that eight of 21 evaluable patients (38%) treated with ME-344 achieved stable disease or better, including five who experienced progression-free survival that was at least twice the duration of their last prior treatment before entry into the study. In addition, one of these patients, a heavily pre-treated patient with small cell lung cancer, achieved a confirmed partial response and remained on study for two years. ME-344 was generally well tolerated at doses equal to or less than 10 mg/kg delivered on a weekly schedule for extended durations. Treatment-related adverse events included nausea, dizziness and fatigue. Dose limiting toxicities were observed at both the 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose levels, consisting primarily of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. 22 Table of Contents In May 2015, we announced new pre-clinical data from a collaboration with the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid showing mitochondria-specific effects of ME-344 in cancer cells, including substantially enhanced anti-tumor activity when combined with a VEGF inhibitor. These new data demonstrate that the anti-cancer effects when combining ME-344 with a VEGF inhibitor are due to an inhibition of both mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism. An investigator-sponsored study of ME-344 in combination with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab (marketed as Avastin ) in HER2-negative breast cancer opened for enrollment in August 2016. Equity Transactions Shelf Registration Statement In April 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC ( shelf registration statement ). The shelf registration statement was declared effective by the SEC in April 2014. The shelf registration statement permits us to sell, from time to time, up to $150 million of common stock, preferred stock and warrants. As of June 30, 2016, there is $104 million aggregate value of securities available under the shelf registration statement. Pursuant to SEC regulations, if the market value of our public float is below $75 million, we cannot sell securities from the shelf registration statement which represent more than one-third of the market value of our non-affiliated public float during any 12-month period. The market value of our non-affiliated public float was less than $75 million as of June 30, 2016. Accordingly, until our non-affiliated public float exceeds $75 million, we may not sell shares with a market value greater than one-third of our non-affiliated public float during any 12-month period under the shelf registration statement. Underwritten Registered Offerings In December 2014, we completed an underwritten registered offering of 11,500,000 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $4.00, pursuant to the April 2014 shelf registration statement. We received net proceeds of $43.1 million associated with the offering, after costs of $2.9 million. In October 2013, we completed an underwritten registered offering of 4,375,000 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $8.00, pursuant to a shelf registration statement. We received net proceeds of $32.7 million associated with the offering, after costs of $2.3 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Clinical Trials Expenses Estimates have been used in determining the expenses under certain clinical trial contracts where services have been performed but not yet invoiced. Generally, the costs associated with clinical trial contracts are based on the number of patients in each trial, the service contracts associated with clinical sites, service providers and drug development contracts. The length of time before actual amounts can be determined will vary, and are therefore estimated based on enrollment of subjects, the length of drug administration cycles, the completion of trials and other events. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation expense for employees and directors is recognized in the statement of operations based on estimated amounts, including the grant date fair value and the expected service period. For stock options, we estimate the grant date fair value using a Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires the use of multiple subjective inputs including estimated future volatility, expected forfeitures and the expected term of the awards. We estimate our expected future volatility based on our stock s historical price volatility. Our stock s future volatility may differ from our estimated volatility at the grant date. For restricted stock unit ( RSU ) equity awards, we estimate the grant date fair value using the Company s closing stock price on the date of grant. Share-based compensation recorded in our statement of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Our estimated forfeiture rates may differ from actual forfeiture rates which would affect the amount of expense recognized during the period. We recognize the value of the awards over the awards requisite service or performance periods. The requisite service period is generally the time over which our share-based awards vest. Unrecognized compensation expense as of June 30, 2016 related to non-vested stock options and RSUs totalled $1.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Such compensation expense is expected to be recognized over weighted-average periods of 1.4 years and 1.9 years, respectively. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations We are providing the following summary of our research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses to supplement the more detailed discussions below. The dollar values in the following tables are in thousands. Research and development expenses Years Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 Clinical and drug development costs $ (8,416 ) $ (18,443 ) $ (14,875 ) Salaries and benefits (3,987 ) (3,994 ) (3,304 ) Patent-related legal costs (427 ) (630 ) (754 ) Other (573 ) (756 ) (398 ) Total research and development expenses $ (13,403 ) $ (23,823 ) $ (19,331 ) General and administrative expenses Years Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 Salaries and benefits $ (4,919 ) $ (6,101 ) $ (5,369 ) Legal and professional fees (748 ) (1,074 ) (1,079 ) Other (1,934 ) (1,773 ) (1,449 ) Total general and administrative expenses $ (7,601 ) $ (8,948 ) $ (7,897 ) Comparison of Years Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 Research and Development: Research and development expenses consist primarily of clinical trial costs (including payments to CROs), pre-clinical study costs, cost to manufacture our drug candidates for non-clinical and clinical studies, and salaries and other personnel costs. Research and development expenses decreased $10.4 million to $13.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 compared to $23.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of $7.1 million in costs associated with Phase II clinical trials for Pracinostat related to MDS, a $1.6 million decrease in costs related to our other clinical trials and a $1.1 million decrease in drug manufacturing for Pracinostat. General and Administrative: General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.3 million to $7.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 compared to $8.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease primarily relates to lower levels of share-based compensation expense. Other income or expense: We received interest on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $143,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016 and $78,000 for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase was due to higher yields during the year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the year ended June 30, 2015. Comparison of Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 Research and Development: Research and development expenses increased $4.5 million to $23.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 compared to $19.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase was primarily due to costs associated with Phase II clinical trials for Pracinostat. Additionally, we incurred costs associated with a Phase I clinical trial for ME-344, as well as pre-clinical costs related to ME-401. Salaries and benefit costs, including share-based compensation of $1.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015, increased due to hiring of additional employees. General and Administrative: General and administrative expenses increased by $1.0 million to $8.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 compared to $7.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase primarily relates to higher levels of salaries and benefits. Other income or expense: We received interest on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $78,000 for the year ended June 30, 2015 and $81,000 for the year ended June 30, 2014. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ). The standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Subsequent to adoption the Company will apply the guidance in ASU 2014-15 to assess going concern. 24 Table of Contents In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases , which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . Topic 326 amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, Topic 326 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current U.S. GAAP, however Topic 326 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have accumulated losses of $177.0 million since inception and expect to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2016, we had $45.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, which we believe will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months. Additionally, in August 2016, we received $15.0 million from Helsinn as part of an exclusive license, development and commercialization agreement. In a related transaction, Helsinn made a $5.0 million equity investment in the Company. Our current business operations are focused on continuing the clinical development of our drug candidates. Changes to our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future use of existing cash resources. To date, we have obtained cash and funded our operations primarily through equity financings. In order to continue the development of our drug candidates, at some point in the future we expect to pursue one or more capital transactions, whether through the sale of equity securities, license agreements or entry into strategic partnerships. Sources and Uses of Our Cash Net cash used in operations for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $17.9 million compared to $28.1 million in the year ended June 30, 2015 due to a decrease in expenses incurred for research and development and general and administrative costs as described above. Net cash used in operations for the year ended June 30, 2015 was $28.1 million compared to $19.5 million in the year ended June 30, 2014 due to an increase in expenses incurred for research and development and general and administrative costs as described above. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $10.0 million compared to $10.1 million used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2015. The change was primarily due to lower acquisition of short-term investments in 2015 compared to 2016, net of maturities. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2015 was $10.1 million compared to $35.1 million in the year ended June 30, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to higher acquisition of short-term investments in 2015 compared to 2016, net of maturities. There was no cash provided by financing activities during the year ended June 30, 2016 compared with $43.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2015. Cash raised during the year ended June 30, 2015 reflected $43.1 million net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities was $43.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2015 compared with $32.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2014. Cash raised during the year ended June 30, 2015 reflected $43.1 million in net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock. Cash raised during the year ended June 30, 2014 reflected $32.7 million net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock. Contractual Obligations We have contracted with various consultants and third parties to assist us in pre-clinical research and development and clinical trials work for our leading drug compounds. The contracts are terminable at any time, but obligate us to reimburse the 25 Table of Contents providers for any time or costs incurred through the date of termination. Additionally, we have employment agreements with certain of our current employees that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting for share-based awards if their employment is terminated under specified circumstances. We have leased approximately 8,800 square feet of office space, located at 11975 El Camino Real, Suite 101, San Diego, California 92130. The location houses the Company s executive and administrative offices. The lease commenced in July 2010 and expires in June 2017. The monthly rental rate is approximately $29,000 over the remaining lease term, plus a pro rata share of certain building expenses. The remaining contractual obligation is $343,000. We believe these or similar facilities will be available upon expiration of our current lease. License Agreement In September 2012, the Company entered into a license agreement with CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( CyDex ). Under the license agreement, CyDex granted to the Company an exclusive, nontransferable license to intellectual property rights relating to Captisol for use with the Company s two isoflavone-based drug compounds. The Company agreed to pay to CyDex a non-refundable license issuance fee, future milestone payments, and royalties at a low, single-digit percentage rate on future sales of the Company s approved drugs utilizing Captisol. Contemporaneously with the license agreement, the Company and CyDex entered into a commercial supply agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase 100% of its requirements for Captisol from CyDex. The Company may terminate both the license agreement and the supply agreement for convenience at any time upon 90 days prior written notice. S*Bio Asset Purchase In August 2012, we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with S*Bio, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire certain assets comprised of intellectual property and technology including rights to Pracinostat, in exchange for $500,000 of common stock. On August 22, 2012, we completed the asset purchase and issued 195,756 shares of common stock to S*Bio. We also agreed to make certain milestone payments to S*Bio based on the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and net sales-based milestones, as well as to make certain contingent earnout payments to S*Bio. Milestone payments will be made to S*Bio up to an aggregate amount of $75.2 million if certain U.S., E.U. and Japanese regulatory approvals are obtained and if certain net sales thresholds are met in North America, the E.U. and Japan. The first milestone payment of $200,000 in cash plus $500,000 payable in cash or in shares of the Company s common stock will be due upon the first dosing of a patient in a Phase III clinical trial or other pivotal trial, for any indication. Subsequent milestone payments will be due upon certain regulatory approvals and sales-based events. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has accrued $250,000 for potential future payments. °Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market interest rates relates primarily to the investments of cash balances and short-term investments. We have cash reserves held in U.S. dollars and we place funds on deposit with financial institutions, which are readily available. Our short-term investments consist solely of U.S. government securities with a maturity of three to twelve months. We place our cash deposits with high credit quality financial institutions and by policy limit the amount of credit exposure to any one corporation or bank. These deposits are in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) insurance limits. We are adverse to principal loss and we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We seek to mitigate default risk by depositing funds with high credit quality financial institutions, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one corporation or bank, by purchasing short-term investments consisting of U.S. government securities, and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any such financial institution. We do not consider the effects of interest rate movements to be a material risk to our financial condition. °Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data MEI Pharma, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2016 Note 1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company MEI Pharma, Inc., or the Company , is an oncology company focused on the clinical development of novel therapies for cancer. The Company s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol MEIP . The Company was incorporated in December 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Novogen Limited ( Novogen ). In December 2012, Novogen distributed to its shareholders substantially all of its MEI Pharma common stock. The Company s business purpose is the development of drugs for the treatment of cancer. The Company s portfolio of drug candidates includes Pracinostat, an orally available histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor being developed for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) who are unfit to receive induction therapy. In August 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive worldwide license, development and commercialization agreement with Helsinn Healthcare SA ( Helsinn ) for Pracinostat in AML and other potential indications. The Company s clinical development portfolio also includes ME-401, an oral inhibitor of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) delta that is expected to enter a Phase Ib study in patients with recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) or follicular non-Hodgkin s lymphoma ( fNHL ) in the third quarter of calendar year 2016. The Company is also developing ME-344, an isoflavone-based mitochondrial inhibitor that is expected to enter an investigator-sponsored clinical study in HER2-negative breast cancer in the third quarter of calendar year 2016. The Company owns exclusive worldwide rights to ME-401 and ME-344. The results of pre-clinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and the Company s current drug candidates may not have favorable results in later studies or trials. The commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and market products that are more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than the Company s drug candidates. The Company will need substantial additional funds to progress the clinical trial program for the drug candidates Pracinostat, ME-401 and ME-344, and to develop new compounds. The actual amount of funds that will be needed are determined by a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company s control. Negative U.S. and global economic conditions may pose challenges to the Company s business strategy, which relies on funding from the financial markets or collaborators. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ). The standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Subsequent to adoption the Company will apply the guidance in ASU 2014-15 to assess its ability to continue as a going concern. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases , which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance.

The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . Topic 326 amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, Topic 326 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current U.S. GAAP, however Topic 326 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. ASU 2016-13 affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade 32 Table of Contents receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its financial statements. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The Company uses estimates that affect the reported amounts (including assets, liabilities and expenses) and related disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. Cash is maintained at financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. We have never experienced any losses related to these balances. Short-Term Investments Investments that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year are classified as short-term investments. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s short-term investments consisted of $35.1 million and $45.1 million, respectively, in U.S. government securities. The short-term investments held as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 had maturity dates of less than one year, are considered to be held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Due to the short-term maturities of these instruments, the amortized cost approximates the related fair values. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the gross holding gains and losses were immaterial. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts payable approximate the related fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The Company invests its excess cash in financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash, such as money market funds and U.S. government securities. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is measured under a three-tier fair value hierarchy as follows: Level 1 fair value is determined from observable, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 fair value is determined from quoted prices for similar items in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar items in markets that are not active. Level 3 fair value is determined using the entity s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Cash equivalents, where applicable, and short-term investments are classified as Level 1 as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of patents acquired from S*Bio in August 2012, relating to a family of heterocyclic compounds that inhibit HDACs. Capitalized amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the intellectual property of 14 years from the date of acquisition. The carrying values of intangible assets are periodically reviewed to determine if the facts and circumstances suggest that a potential impairment may have occurred. Results of operations for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 do not reflect any write-downs associated with the potential impairment of intangible assets. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally three to seven years) using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include costs paid to third-party contractors to perform research, conduct clinical trials and develop and manufacture drug materials. Clinical trial costs, including costs associated with third-party contractors, are a significant component of research and development expenses. The Company accrues research and development costs based on work performed. In determining the amount to accrue, management relies on estimates of total costs based on contract components completed, the enrollment of subjects, the completion of trials, and other events. Costs incurred related to the purchase of in-process research and development for early-stage products or products that are not commercially viable and ready for use, or have no alternative future use, are charged to expense in the period incurred. 33 Table of Contents License Fees Costs incurred related to the licensing of products that have not yet received regulatory approval to be marketed, or that are not commercially viable and ready for use, or have no alternative future use, are charged to expense in the period incurred. Share-based Compensation Share-based compensation expense for employees and directors is recognized in the statement of operations based on estimated amounts, including the grant date fair value and the expected service period. For stock options, the Company estimates the grant date fair value using a Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires the use of multiple subjective inputs including estimated future volatility, expected forfeitures and the expected term of the awards. The Company estimates the expected future volatility based on the stock s historical price volatility. The stock s future volatility may differ from our estimated volatility at the grant date. For restricted stock unit ( RSU ) equity awards, the Company estimates the grant date fair value using the Company s closing stock price on the date of grant. Share-based compensation recorded in the statement of operations is based on the awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The estimated forfeiture rates may differ from actual forfeiture rates which would affect the amount of expense recognized during the period. The Company recognizes the value of the awards over the awards requisite service or performance periods. The requisite service period is generally the time over which the share-based awards vest. Interest and Dividend Income Interest on cash balances is recognized when earned. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive the payment is established. Income Taxes The Company s income tax expense consists of current and deferred income tax expense or benefit. Current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to tax credits and loss carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has established a valuation allowance to fully reserve its net deferred tax assets. Tax rate changes are reflected in income during the period such changes are enacted. Changes in ownership of the Company may limit the amount of net operating loss carry-forwards that can be utilized in the future to offset taxable income. The FASB Topic on Income Taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2016 and 2015. Net Loss Per Share Basic and diluted net loss per share are computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less any shares subject to repurchase or forfeiture. There were no shares of common stock subject to repurchase or forfeiture for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Net loss per share was determined as follows (in thousands, except share and per share amounts): Years ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 Numerator Net loss $ (20,862 ) $ (32,694 ) $ (27,148 ) Denominator Weighted average common shares outstanding 34,400,441 28,204,356 20,061,387 Basic and diluted net loss per share $ (0.61 ) $ (1.16 ) $ (1.35 ) 34 Table of Contents Because the Company is in a net loss position, it has excluded stock options, warrants, unvested restricted stock units and convertible preferred stock from its calculation of diluted net loss per share, and the Company s diluted net loss per share is the same as the Company s basic net loss per share. For the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not have any items that would be classified as other comprehensive income or losses. The table below presents the potentially dilutive securities that were excluded in the Company s calculation of diluted net loss per share allocable to common stockholders as they were antidilutive as of June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Years ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 Anti-dilutive securities not included in diluted loss per share: Stock options 2,827,172 1,614,317 1,194,854 Warrants 3,761,407 3,761,407 4,900,999 Restricted stock units 496,348 266,667 400,000 Total anti-dilutive securities not included in diluted net loss per share 7,084,927 5,642,391 6,495,853 Note 2. Intangible Assets Intangible assets consisted of the following, in thousands: June 30, 2016 2015 S*Bio Patents - Gross $ 500 $ 500 S*Bio Patents - Accumulated amortization (134 ) (99 ) Intangible assets, net $ 366 $ 401 Amortization expense of intangible assets for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $35,000, $34,000 and $35,000, respectively. We expect to record amortization of $35,000 per year through 2026 for our S*Bio patents. Note 3. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consisted of the following, in thousands: June 30, 2016 2015 Furniture and equipment $ 127 $ 123 Leasehold improvements 31 127 154 Less: accumulated depreciation (78 ) (86 ) Property and equipment, net $ 49 $ 68 Depreciation expense of property and equipment for the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $23,000, $30,000 and $15,000, respectively. Note 4. Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities consisted of the following, in thousands: June 30, 2016 2015 Accrued pre-clinical and clinical trial expenses $ 2,816 $ 2,881 Accrued compensation and benefits 1,342 995 Accrued legal and professional services expenses 215 141 Other 60 79 Total accrued liabilities $ 4,433 $ 4,096 Note 5. Stockholders Equity Equity Transactions Shelf Registration Statement In April 2014, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC ( shelf registration statement ). The shelf registration statement was declared effective by the SEC in April 2014. The shelf registration statement permits the Company to sell, from time to time, up to $150.0 million of common stock, preferred stock and warrants. As of June 30, 2016, there is $104.0 million aggregate value of securities available under the shelf registration statement. Pursuant to SEC regulations, if the market value of the Company s public float is below $75.0 million, the Company cannot sell securities from the shelf registration statement which represent more than one-third of the market value of the Company s non-affiliated public float during any 12-month period. The market value of the Company s non-affiliated public float was less than $75.0 million as of June 30, 2016. Accordingly, until the Company s non-affiliated public float exceeds $75.0 million, the Company may not sell shares with a market value greater than one-third of its non-affiliated public float during any 12-month period under the shelf registration statement. 35 Table of Contents Underwritten Registered Offerings In December 2014, the Company completed an underwritten registered offering of 11,500,000 shares of its common stock at a price per share of $4.00 pursuant to the April 2014 shelf registration statement. The Company received net proceeds of $43.1 million associated with the offering, after costs of $2.9 million. In October 2013, the Company completed an underwritten registered offering of 4,375,000 shares of its common stock at a price per share of $8.00 pursuant to a shelf registration statement. The Company received net proceeds of $32.7 million associated with the offering, after costs of $2.3 million. Description of Capital Stock The Company s total authorized share capital is 113,100,000 shares consisting of 113,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.00000002 par value per share, and 100,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. Common Stock The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company s affairs, holders of the common stock will be entitled to share rateably in all the Company s assets that are remaining after payment of the Company s liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding shares of preferred stock. All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subject to any series of preferred stock that the Company has issued or that the Company may issue in the future. The holders of common stock have no pre-emptive rights and are not subject to future calls or assessments by the Company. Preferred Stock The Company s Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock with par value of $.01 per share in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions in respect of that preferred stock, including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), redemption prices and liquidation preferences, and the number of shares constituting such series and the designation of any such series, without future vote or action by the stockholders. Therefore, the board without the approval of the stockholders could authorize the issue of preferred stock with voting, conversion and other rights that could affect the voting power, dividend and other rights of the holders of shares or that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control. There were no shares of preferred stock outstanding as of June 30, 2016 or 2015. Warrants As of June 30, 2016, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 315,484 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $7.14 per share, which expire in May 2017, issued in conjunction with the Company s May 2012 rights offering; outstanding Series A warrants and warrants issued to the Company s placement agent for its May 2011 private placement to purchase up to 215,721 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00 per share, which expire in November 2016, and warrants to purchase 3,230,202 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $3.12 per share, which expire in December 2017, issued in conjunction with its December 2012 private placement. Note 6. Share-based Compensation The Company uses equity-based compensation programs to provide long-term performance incentives for its employees. These incentives consist primarily of stock options and RSUs. In December 2008, the Company adopted the MEI Pharma, Inc. 2008 Stock Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan ( 2008 Plan ), as amended and restated in 2011 and 2013, under which 6,686,000 shares of common stock are authorized for issuance. The 2008 Plan provides for the grant of options and/or other stock-based or stock-denominated awards to the Company s non-employee directors, officers, employees and advisors. As of June 30, 2016, there were 3,005,060 shares available for future grant under the 2008 Plan. Total share-based compensation expense for all stock awards consists of the following, in thousands: Years Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 Research and development $ 1,871 $ 1,030 $ 1,549 General and administrative 852 3,193 3,198 Total share-based compensation $ 2,723 $ 4,223 $ 4,747 Stock Options Stock options granted to employees vest ratably each month for a period of 36 months, or vest 25% one year from the date of grant and ratably each month thereafter for a period of 36 months and expire either five years or ten years from the date of grant. Stock options granted to directors vest ratably each month for periods ranging from seven to 36 months from the date of grant and expire either five years or ten years from the date of grant. As of June 30, 2016, there were a total of 2,827,172 options outstanding. 36 Table of Contents A summary of the Company s stock option activity and related data follows: Number of Options Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at June 30, 2015 1,614,317 $ 7.07 Granted 1,593,297 1.59 Forfeited / Cancelled (323,972 ) 4.44 Expired (56,470 ) 6.65 Outstanding at June 30, 2016 2,827,172 $ 4.29 6.0 $ 19,500 Vested and exercisable at June 30, 2016 1,362,955 $ 5.42 4.5 $ No stock option exercises occurred during the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 or 2014. As of June 30, 2016, the aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the closing price of the Company s common stock of $1.36 on that date. The total fair value of options that vested during the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $3.1 million, $2.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively. A summary of the Company s nonvested stock option activity: Number of Options Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Nonvested at June 30, 2015 988,685 $ 5.65 Granted 1,593,297 1.35 Forfeited (251,945 ) 2.90 Vested (865,820 ) 3.53 Nonvested at June 30, 2016 1,464,217 $ 2.69 Unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options totalled $1.4 million as of June 30, 2016. Such compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. As of June 30, 2016, the Company expects all outstanding options to vest. The Company uses a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options. To calculate these fair values, the following weighted-average assumptions were used: Years ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 Risk-free interest rate 1.7 % 1.6 % 1.5 % Expected life (years) 5.8 5.0 5.0 Expected volatility 116.7 % 115.9 % 145.9 % Dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Weighted-average grant date fair value $ 1.35 $ 4.81 $ 6.85 Restricted Stock Units In March 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted 400,000 RSUs to the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Daniel P. Gold. Each RSU represents the contingent right to receive one share of the Company s common stock. One-third of the RSUs vested on August 30, 2014, one-third vested on August 30, 2015, and the remaining one-third will vest on August 30, 2016. The shares underlying the RSUs will be delivered to Dr. Gold on the earliest to occur of (i) March 29, 2018, (ii) Dr. Gold s death, disability or separation from service from the Company for any reason, or (iii) a change in control involving the Company. The fair value of the RSUs on the date of grant was $3.5 million. The grant date fair value per unit was $8.63. In June 2016, the Company granted 364,726 RSUs to employees. Each RSU represents the contingent right to receive one share of the Company s common stock. The RSUs were subject to performance criteria that were met in August 2016. The RSUs will vest in August 2018. The fair value of the RSUs was measured at $1.61 per unit on the date the performance criteria were met. Under the terms of the 2008 Plan, each of these RSUs is calculated as 1.25 shares of common stock for purposes of determining the number of shares available for future grant. There were forfeitures of 1,712 RSUs in June 2016, and 363,014 unvested RSUs were outstanding as of June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Company s RSUs was approximately $0.6 million and is expected to be recognized over approximately 1.9 years. 37 Table of Contents Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies The Company has contracted with various consultants and third parties to assist it in pre-clinical research and development and clinical trials work for its leading drug compounds. The contracts are terminable at any time, but obligate the Company to reimburse the providers for any time or costs incurred through the date of termination. The Company also has employment agreements with certain of its current employees that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting for share-based awards if their employment is terminated under specified circumstances. The Company currently leases approximately 8,800 square feet of office space for the Company s executive and administrative offices. The monthly rental rate is approximately $29,000 during the remaining term of the lease, plus a pro-rata share of certain building expenses. The lease expires in June 2017. Future minimum payments under the lease are $343,000 as of June 30, 2016. Asset Purchase Agreement In August 2012, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with S*Bio, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire certain assets comprised of intellectual property and technology including rights to Pracinostat, in exchange for $500,000 of common stock. On August 22, 2012, the Company completed the asset purchase and issued 195,756 shares of common stock to S*Bio. The Company has also agreed to make certain milestone payments to S*Bio based on the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and net sales-based milestones, as well as to make certain contingent earnout payments to S*Bio. Milestone payments will be made to S*Bio up to an aggregate amount of $75.2 million if certain U.S., E.U. and Japanese regulatory approvals are obtained and if certain net sales thresholds are met in North America, the E.U. and Japan. The first milestone payment of $200,000 plus shares of the Company s common stock having a value of $500,000 will be due upon the first dosing of a patient in a Phase III clinical trial or other pivotal trial, for any indication. Subsequent milestone payments will be due upon certain regulatory approvals and sales-based events. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has accrued $250,000 for potential future payments. License Agreement In September 2012, the Company entered into a license agreement with CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( CyDex ). Under the license agreement, CyDex granted to the Company an exclusive, nontransferable license to intellectual property rights relating to Captisol for use with the Company s two isoflavone-based drug compounds. The Company agreed to pay to CyDex a non-refundable license issuance fee, future milestone payments, and royalties at a low, single-digit percentage rate on future sales of the Company s approved drugs utilizing Captisol. Contemporaneously with the license agreement, the Company and CyDex entered into a commercial supply agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase 100% of its requirements for Captisol from CyDex. The Company may terminate both the license agreement and the supply agreement for convenience at any time upon 90 days prior written notice. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has not accrued any amounts for potential future payments. Note 8. Segment Information The Company has one operating segment, the development of pharmaceutical compounds. All of the Company s assets and liabilities were located in the United States of America as of June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Note 9. Income Taxes Pre-tax loss consists of the following jurisdictions (in thousands): Years ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 Domestic $ (20,862 ) $ (32,694 ) $ (27,148 ) Foreign Pre-tax loss $ (20,862 ) $ (32,694 ) $ (27,148 ) The reconciliation of income tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rates to income tax expense is as follows (in thousands): Years Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % $ % Tax benefit at U.S. statutory rates $ 7,093 34 % $ 11,116 34 % $ 9,230 34 % State tax 1,215 6 % 1,906 6 % 1,583 6 % Other (356 ) -2 % (475 ) -2 % (4 ) 0 % Increase in valuation allowance (7,953 ) -38 % (12,548 ) -38 % (10,810 ) -40 % $ (1 ) 0 % $ (1 ) 0 % $ (1 ) 0 % 38 Table of Contents Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2016 2015 Deferred tax assets: Tax carried forward losses $ 7,730 $ 4,348 Share-based payments 4,904 4,164 Consultant and other accruals 145 35 Fixed and intangible assets 32,484 28,899 Compensation accruals 545 409 Capital loss carryforward 26,382 26,382 Total deferred tax assets 72,190 64,237 Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (72,190 ) (64,237 ) Net deferred tax assets and liabilities $ $ Management evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the amount of the required valuation allowance. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the tax deductions in future tax returns, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2016 and 2015. At such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance would be reduced. The Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $19.8 million and $17.4 million as of June 30, 2016. The federal and state net operating losses will begin to expire in 2022 and 2029, respectively. The Company also had federal and state capital loss carryforwards of approximately $66.2 million that will expire in 2017. The Company s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards may be substantially limited due to ownership changes that have occurred or that could occur in the future under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state laws. The Company has not completed a study to determine whether one or more ownership changes have occurred. None of the Company s prior income tax returns have been selected for examination by a major taxing jurisdiction; however, the statutes of limitations for various filings remain open. The oldest filings subject to potential examination for federal, state, and foreign purposes are 2013, 2012, 2012, respectively. If the Company utilizes a net operating loss related to a closed year, the statute for that year would re-open. The Company has not reduced any tax benefit on its financial statements due to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2016 and it is not aware of any circumstance that would significantly change this result through the end of fiscal year 2017. To the extent the Company incurs income-tax related penalties or interest, the Company recognizes them as additional income tax expense. Note 10.

Subsequent Events In August 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive license, development and commercialization agreement with Helsinn, a Swiss pharmaceutical corporation, for Pracinostat in AML and other potential indications. Under the terms of the agreement, Helsinn is granted a worldwide exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pracinostat, and is responsible for funding its global development and commercialization.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. °Item 9A. Controls and Procedures (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures At the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. A control system no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within the Company are detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met. (b) Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a - 15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management maintains a comprehensive system of controls intended to ensure that transactions are executed in accordance with management s authorization, assets are safeguarded and financial records are reliable. Management also takes steps to ensure that information and communication flows are effective, and to monitor performance, including performance of internal control procedures. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of June 30, 2016. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 has been audited by BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. 41 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders MEI Pharma, Inc. San Diego, California We have audited MEI Pharma, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). MEI Pharma, Inc. s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying, Item 9A, Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, MEI Pharma, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on the COSO criteria . We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the balance sheets of MEI Pharma, Inc. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2016 and our report dated September 2, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ BDO USA, LLP San Diego, California September 2, 2016 42 Table of Contents °Item 9B.
